*Icons 1.2
# Vector icon database August 2014.
#  
# All user defined tags are 12 characters, menu 
# entries are 32 characters. Up to 60 lines of text
# (each line up to 72 characters) can be accommodated.
#
# This type of database can hold icons for several analysis
# domains (bracketed by *Domain and *End_domain).
#
# For each domain there can be several categories of icons.
#  Each category has a tag and a menu entry (bracketed by
#  *Category and *End_category) and contains one or more icons.
# 
#  For flow domain, category tag `inodes` & `bnodes` should not
#  be edited as they are used for identification.
# 
# Icons have a tag (unique), menu entry, text, attribute,
#  vertices, edges, circles, arcs, filled polygons and
#  text (bracketed by *Item and *End_item) with no blank lines.
# Vertices (*Vertex within range 0.0 to 1.0) are used by:
#  edges (*Edge start vert & end vert & colour name & line style),
#  circles (*Circle centre vert and radius vert),
#  arcs, (*Arc centre vert, start vert & finish vert),
#  filled polygons (*Poly nb of vert & list of vert & colour & fill),
#  dot (*Dot centre vert & colour name & size 0=small 1=4pixel),
#  label (*Label lower left vert).
#  attachment points (*Attach vert and tag).
# Icon attributes (denoted by *Attributes) nb of attributes followed
#  by comma separated text or numbers (must fit on one line).

Door allowing two way flow.
Type 130 is an air flow door component which is '
applicable to vertical opening where bi-directional'
flow may exist. Based on an expression by Cockroft.'
Equation: m = rho.f(W,H,dP)
Supplemental data:
 (1) fluid type (air only)
 (2) door width (m)
 (3) door height (m),
 (4) vertical distance (m) between base of door and
     adjacent air nodes (nodes should be at the same
     height). Where this component type is required for
     several locations with different vertical heights
     you should create multiple door components.
 (5) discharge factor (-)

*Text
Type 420 is a flow corrector or variable flow resis-
tance such as a valve or damper which is represented
as a polynomial. This approach is as if it were a
conduit with local dynamic losses dependent on the
correctors relative position. For actuation in
this component the configuration control file must be
used together otherwise the valve (or damper) is kept
open during the whole simulation.
Supplemental data:
 (1) fluid type (air|water), , polynomial
 (2) cross-sectional area (m^2)
 (3-6) polynomial coefficients a0 - a3 (-) in:
    C = a0+a1.(H/H100)+a2.(H/H100)^2+a3.(H/H100)^3
 where H/H100 is the relative valve/damper position
 (ie. valve stem displacement of damper blade angle).

Type 410 is a general flow corrector or variable
flow resistance such as a valve. Actuation
of this component requires a flow control loop
otherwise it is assumed the valve (or damper) is
open. 
Equation: m = rho.f(comp, signal)
Supplemental data:
 (1) fluid type (1=air, 2=water)
 (2) fluid density rho 0 (kg/m^3),
 (3) presure drop dP0 (Pa),
 (4) linear (1) or logarithmic (2)position dependency,
 (5) volume flow when fully open  k,vs (m^3/s),
 (6) theoretical flow when closed, k,v0 (%)
 (7) lower validity limit k,vr (%).

Type 220 is a variant of a general flow conduit which
ends in a converging 3-leg junction.  It represents
only half of a junction and the branch must be rep-
resented by a similar component.  It is well supported
in the literature.  Supplemental data:

  loss factors, x-sectional area of common junction

     several locations with different vertical heights
     you should create multiple door components.
