Described ZONE with a run of 13 stairs with a diagonal landing leading
to a simple hall at 2.6m (assumes a 200mm floor structure) and a
ceiling at 4.9m. The stair and hall are both 1m wide. It matches 
the below_stair object. No Z transform from the below_stair is
needed if used together.  Remember to re-run a topology check.

A Honewell CM707 thermostat with plastic case and mass for
the circuit and sensors. Separate surf for sensor. Front = south.
Remember to copy bounding surfaces to the parent zone and re-run a
surface topology check. When defining control sensor will be the
surface sen_a.

Q150_brick_S describes the bank of energy cells Quantum 150 heater.
It is raised 120mm above zero to match with Q150_shell_S. It 
takes a 3.3kW input and 1.5kW nominal output. Use a fixed
