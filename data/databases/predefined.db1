Describes ZONE under a typical post-war residential stair with a
straight run of 10 steps (going north) and a right diagonal landing 
for a total of 13 steps and rise of 2.6m and 1m wide. Can be used
with the abv_str_cv_r object in a two level residence. Remember to 
re-run surface topology check.

Described ZONE with a run of 13 stairs with a diagonal landing leading
to a simple hall at 2.6m (assumes a 200mm floor structure) and a
ceiling at 4.9m. The stair and hall are both 1m wide. It matches 
the blw_str_cv_r object. No Z transform from the blw_str_cv_r is
needed if used together.  Remember to re-run a topology check.

A single zone water filled radiator 1.1m wide (along X) x 0.5m high
with a large fin at back to increase surface area. Made of 3mm steel
and set 200mm above base with visual piping and TRV. Remember to
Toggle the zone to water filled! And copy bounding surfaces to the 
parent zone.
