 SYNOPSIS:
 This folder contains reference results generated using ESP-r binaries
 compiled from the ESP-r Central repository. The repository always
 contains the most recent reference result sets for both the development
 branch and trunk.


 REFERENCE RESULT SETS:
 The reference result sets that have been committed to the ESP-r
 repository are listed below. Note that the result version number
 differs from the ESP-r version number used to create it, as the result
 sets are generated using code already committed to the development
 branch.
