This folder is intended to hold model-specific ASCII
databases associated with the test suite. It is imperative
that binary databases not be included in this folder, as
there is no means to convert test-suite databases from 
ascii to binary formats during installation on other 
platforms. 

Current files: 

 - ccht_constr.db1: MLC database describing 
   constructions in CCHT test houses.
