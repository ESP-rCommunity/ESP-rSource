This directory contains a test case for the adsorption storage unit plant component model.
The plant component is connect to a SOFC plant component (heat source) and hot water tank (heat sink).
The operation of the plant components is controlled by an adsorption storage controller, which was
created specifically for this plant network. Please refer to (Mottillo, 2006) for more information.

A simulation that spans a charge and discharge period of the adsorption storage system must be 
separated into two simulations; this is a shortcoming of the adsorption storage component model.
For example, to perform a one-year simulation for this test case, 3 simulations are required:
(1) for the period of January 1 - April 30 (discharge period); (2) for the period of May 1 -
September 30 (charge period) and (3) for the period of October 1 - December 31 (discharge period).
The temperature and pressure of the adsorber node at the end of one simulation (this can be obtained
from the timestep output in the out.csv file) is input as the initial temperature and pressure of the 
adsorber (for the adsorption storage plant component) in the plant network file for the next simulation.

It should be noted that run times are very long - this is to be addressed in future work. A 4 month simulation
requires a run time of approximately 12 hours!
