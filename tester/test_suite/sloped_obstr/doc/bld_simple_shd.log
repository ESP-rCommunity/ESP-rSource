Notes on simple 1 zone building model with external shading,
convective heating and ideal control:

This model (bld_simple.cfg) relates to an L-shaped
reception with convective heating.  The simple representation
contains a single thermal zone, but the resolution of the
model has been increased by including a shading and
insolation analysis.

The obstructions represent an adjacent building.  Several
obstructions are used so as not to intersect the east and 
west walls and the roof. 

The following files are used in this example problem.
