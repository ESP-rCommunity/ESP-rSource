auto-tester/plt_zone_gain_test: 

This folder contains testcases exercising the coupling 
between plant component heat losses and containing 
zone/surface/construction node heat injection. The base
model is comprised of two adjacent zones that are 
regulated by ideal controllers to a temperature of 15oC.
Under steady-state conditions, the total heat extracted 
by the controllers should be equal to the total flux 
the contained plant component.

The following models are provided:

 - plt_multizone_construction_gain_test.cfg: 
 
   Tests heat injection from a containment into a node 
   within an interior partition. 
   
 - plt_multizone_surface_gain_test.cfg:
 
   Tests radaint heat injection from a containment at 
   the inside surface of an interior partition.
   
 - plt_multizone_zone_gain_test.cfg:
 
   Tests radiant and convective heat injection from a 
   containment to the zone air point (the radiant 
   gains are actually apportioned equally between all 
   zone surfaces)
 
 - plt_multizone_nogain_test.cfg:
 
   Base case model with no containment heat injection.
