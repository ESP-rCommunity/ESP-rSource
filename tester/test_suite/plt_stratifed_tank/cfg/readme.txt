Test #1 of the immersed HX. The model includes a stratified tank, initially at 15°C; there is no water circulation through the tank. Water at 50°C is circulated through the first HX at a rate of 15 kg/h.

Test #2 of the immersed HX. The model includes a stratified tank, initially at 15°C; there is no water circulation through the tank. Water at 50°C is circulated through the second HX at a rate of 15 kg/h.

Test #3 of the immersed HX. The model includes a stratified tank, initially at 15°C; there is no water circulation through the tank. Both HXs are active, 50°C water is circulated through the bottom HX and 60°C water is circulated through the top HX, both at 15 kg/h.
