Exemplar to show working of flow network side MISO controller. All details are
similar to the base case model cellular_bc except ventilation strategy which uses
an airflow network to ventilate the offices at 8l/s from 0830 to 1730. Extra
ventilation is supplied to overcome summertime overheating as detailed below.

Manager A has an 8l/s fan operating from 0900-1700 and an extra
ventilation fan comes on when dbT>26degC

Manager B has a similar 8l/s fan but the extra fan comes on when
dbT>26degC OR when CO2 concentration > 2000ppm. This control is
implemented as a MISO control. 

Airflow network is shown graphically in ../images/afn_and_ctl.jpg
