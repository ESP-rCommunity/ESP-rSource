_____________________________

This model implements various scheduled and short timestep
infiltration regimes on four otherwise identical zones. Each
zone is controlled within the temperature range of 20-24C
during office hours.  There are no lights or small power loads.

Each zone has one occupant but the gains fluctuate during the
day from between 20 to 100W. The pattern is the same in all
zones on weekdays and saturdays. There is no occupant on Sunday.

Zone manager has 0.33 ac/h (0.0037m3/s) infiltration at all
hours on weekdays, saturdays and sunday.

Zone man_opr_inf has a nominal infiltration of 0.33 ac/h 
(0.0037m3/s) at all hours unless the zone temperature drops
below 19C in which case infiltration falls to 0.1 ac/h. If
the zone temperature rises above 21C infiltration is increased
to 1.0 ac/h and if it rises above 23C infiltration is increased
to 2.0 ac/h. This approximates a window opening strategy.

Zone man_opr_wind has a nominal infiltration of 0.33 ac/h 
(0.0037m3/s) at all hours unless the outside wind speed
drops below 1m/s and in this condition infiltration is
set to 0.1 ac/h. If the wind speed exceeds 3m/s the infiltration
is raised to 1.0 ac/h and if the wind speed exceeds 4m/s
the infiltration is set to 2 ac/h. This approximates a
facade that is sensitive to wind speed. 

Zone man_tmpr_inf replaces the operational schedule of infiltration
with hourly data held in a temporal file. Temporal data sources
allow complex patterns (in this case hourly) to be associated with
a model. In this zone infiltration varies from 0.1 to 0.4 ac/h
over the period of the simulation.  

The standard simulation is a may week from 3 May to 9 May with
two startup days. Note that the temporal data includes the
period of 1 May - 10 May so that infiltration data can be
accessed during the startup period. The temporal data also
extends to the day after the simulation.
