The standard regression tests exercised by 'tester.pl'
are located in the directory 'test_suite'. The directory
'additional_tests' contains tests that can optionally
be exercised by 'tester.pl'. For example,
'additional_tests/A42_fuel_cell_comp_tests' contains
50 tests that form the IEA/ECBCS Annex 42 comparative
test suite for its fuel cell cogeneration model.

The inclusion of these additional tests in 'test_suite'
would have unduly lengthened routine regression testing,
and hence they have been located in 'additional_tests'.
These additional tests can be exercised by using 'tester.pl's
'--file' option, e.g.

 ./tester.pl --path ../additional_tests reference_bps test_bps

Additional Tests currently available:

  - A42_combustion_cogen_comp_tests: Comparative testing  
    suite comprising 44 test cases, which were  developed 
    to support validation of the IEA/ECBCS Annex 42 
    combustion cogeneration model
    
  - A42_fuel_cell_comp_tests: Comparative testing
    suite comprising 44 test cases, which were  developed
    to support validation of the IEA/ECBCS Annex 42
    fuel cell model.

  - ASHRAE-140: Tests from ASHRAE's Standard 140 (not
    yet incorporated).

  - ESP-r_TRNSYS_co-simulation: Test cases for exercising the
