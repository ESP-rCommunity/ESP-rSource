This directory contains test cases that exercise the co-simulator's ability to simulate an air-based system.

This test case is based upon BESTEST case 600 and uses a minimal plant network consisting of a sending and receiving ACCs (Air-based Coupling Components) together with supply and return air ducts in ESPr.

There are three variations on the HVAC system in TRNSYS (trying to maintain a constant room temperature): 

D_1  compises a fan and a heater and uses an on/off controller to 	control the fan (sending air at a constant temperature)
      
D_2  compises a fan and a heater and uses an on/off controller to 	control the fan (sending air at a constant temperature).  In 	addition to there is an uncontrolled humidifier.

D_3  comprises a system with a fan, humidifier and heating coil, 	together with humidity and temperature controllers.
