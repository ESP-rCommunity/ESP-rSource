This directory contains test cases that exercise the co-simulator's
ability to represent differing numbers of ports between the
simulators and the Harmonizer.

The variants are:
    F_1   ESP-r sends separate streams of water to the Harmonizer
          through two hydronic couplings.  The streams are mixed
          together in TRNSYS and a single stream is returned to the
          Harmonizer.
    F_2   TRNSYS sends separate streams of water to the Harmonizer
          through two hydronic couplings.  The streams are mixed
          together in ESP-r and a single stream is returned to the
          Harmonizer. [Yet to be added]
