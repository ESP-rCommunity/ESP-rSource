This directory contains test cases that exercise the co-simulator's
ability to represent fragmented plant networks in which both ESP-r
and TRNSYS resolve portions of the overall network.

There are four co-simulation variants, all of which consider a SOFC
micro-cogeneration convective heating system with thermal storage in a
water tank.  In addition, there is an ESP-r-only model that represents
the entire system in ESP-r's plant domain.

The four co-simulation variants are:
    E_1   The pump that circulates hot water from the storage tank to
          the fan-coil that conditions the building zone has been moved
          from ESP-r to TRNSYS.
    E_2   As E_1 but now the pump that circulates water between the
          storage tank and the SOFC has been moved from ESP-r to TRNSYS.
    E_3   As E_2 but now the water-air heat exchanger of the fan-coil
          has been moved from ESP-r to TRNSYS.
    E_4   As E_1 but now the parasitic heat loss from the TRNSYS pump
          is injected as a casual gain to one of the zones in the ESP-r
          building model.
