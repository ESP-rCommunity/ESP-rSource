              Installing ESP-r Climate Databases



     The climate database in this directory is as required by ESP-r
when implemented on a SUN 3 or 4 workstation and will have
been transferred to /usr/esru/esp-r/climate automatically
at installation time.  For other machine architectures
an ASCII equivalent file, clm67.a, is available which must be converted
to binary before being transferred to the above directory.
The ESP-r module clm should be used to do the conversion
(see Section 4 of the ESP-r manual).

Other climate collections, most notably the European Test Reference
Year set, are available from ESRU on request.
