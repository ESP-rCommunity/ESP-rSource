This directory contains sample configuration files
(leading . removed) which may prove useful to an
ESP-r user. You may wish to "borrow" some of the
definitions therein.

If you want to modify the standard 3rd party programs 
invoked by ESP-r for graphing, image viewing etc, 
copy the file esprc to .esprc in your home directory,
and modify it accordingly.

Place the following in your .login file:

      setenv EFONT_0 6x12
      setenv EFONT_1 6x13
      setenv EFONT_2 8x13
      setenv EFONT_3 9x15
