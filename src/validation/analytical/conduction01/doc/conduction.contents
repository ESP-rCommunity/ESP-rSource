Synopsis
 
Synopsis of the model Analytical validation of the transient heat conduction
defined in conduction.cfg generated on Thu Aug 30 08:33:01 2012. Notes
associated with the model are in ../doc/conduction.log
 
The model is located at latitude   50.00 with a longitude difference of   0.00
from the local time meridian. The year used in simulations is 1999 and
weekends occur on Saturday and Sunday.
The site exposure is typical city centre and the ground reflectance is 0.20.
