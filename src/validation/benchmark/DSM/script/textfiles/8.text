\subsection{Case 8: Case 4 with solar water heating and wind turbine}
The solar water heating module directly adds heat to the water heating system of the model. This is reflected in the final calculation of DHW energy where the proportion supplied by solar energy is deducted. Energy supplied from the thermal collector is given by
\begin{center}
$Q_{ses}=I*K_{s}*A$
\end{center}
where\\
$Q_{ses}$ = is the annual useful DHW contribution of the solar energy system, $kWh$\\
$I$ = global solar radiation at module surface, $kWh$ (taken from climate file)\\
$K_{s}$ = annual system conversion efficiency taken as 38\% from SBEM technical manual\\
$A$ = area of solar energy system in $m^{2}$ (provided by user)\\
The global solar radiation at the module surface is calculated by interpolating from insolation values at various angles of inclinations and orientations. These results have been pre-calculated and held in a database. The insolation values used are integrated over the whole year therefore monthly values are not available.
In this model the total energy generated by the solar energy system is 34.2MWh p.a.\\
Energy from the wind turbine is also calculated using the method provided in the SBEM technical manual. It is detailed as follows:
\begin{center}
$Q_{wt}=0.5*rho*C_{R}(z)*V^{3}*A*EPF*K_{wt}/1000$                \end{center}
where\\
$Q_{wt}$ = energy provided by wind turbine ($kWh$)\\
$rho$ = density of air taken as $1.225kg/m^{3}$\\
$C_{R}(z) = KR*ln(z/z0)$\\
$KR$ = terrain factor taken from SBEM technical manual\\
$z$ = hub height ($m$)\\
$z_{0}$ = roughness length taken from SBEM technical manual ($m$)\\
$V$ = mean annual wind speed from the climate file ($m/s$)\\
$A$ = turbine swept area ($m^{2}$)\\
$A = pi*D^{2}/4$ where $D$ is diameter of wind turbine ($m$)\\
$EPF$ = energy pattern factor calculated using the hourly wind speed data from climate file. This is given as
\begin{center}
$EPF = APD/(0.5*rho*V^{3})$, where\\
$APD = \Sigma0.5*rho*V_{i}^{3}$
\end{center}
$V_{i}$ = hourly average wind speed from climate file ($m/s$)\\
$K_{wt}$ = wind turbine efficiency of conversion taken from SBEM technical manual\\
Again the calculation is done for the whole year and monthly values are not available. In this model the total energy generated by the wind turbine is 56.5MWh p.a. Summary results are provided in the table below.\\
