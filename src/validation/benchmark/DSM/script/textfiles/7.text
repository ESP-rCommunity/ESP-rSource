\underline{CONCLUSION:} Emissions for actual and notional are within 0.5\%

\subsection{Case 7: Case 1 with PV panels and biomass boiler}
Due to the introduction of renewable energy sources the BER is lower than case 1. The only difference in calculation for the biomass boiler is that it has a lower carbon emission factor when compared to natural gas in case 1. The PV panels additionally contribute some electrical energy, carbon emissions are hence deducted from the BER in accordance with part L regulations. The electrical output of the PV panels is given by
\begin{center}
$Q=I*K_{e}(1-K_{s})*A$
\end{center}
where\\
$I$ = global solar radiation at module surface kWh (taken from climate file)\\
$K_{e}$ = Conversion efficiency taken from SBEM technical manual (provided by user)\\
$K_{s}$ = system losses taken from SBEM technical manual (provided by user)\\
$A$ = area of PV panels in m2 (provided by user)\\
The global solar radiation at the module surface is calculated by interpolating from insolation values at various angles of inclinations and orientations. These results have been pre-calculated and held in a database. The insolation values used are integrated over the whole year therefore monthly values are not available.\\
In this model the total energy generated by the PV panel is 10125kWh. Summary results are provided in the table below.\\
