Notes: 
This is an administrative and support building for a university
and is a mix of public spaces, support facilities and cellular
offices with a small conference facility on the top floor.

The building has a SE facing atria the full height of the main
facade of the building and a saller atria on the SW for circulation
space to adjacent buildings.

There are two light wells which allow warm stale air to rise to
the top from the open plan offices for return to the plant room
on the ground level.

Most of the levels are open to the front atria. Ventilation is via
raised floor system in each floor.  Cellular offices have operable
windows, primarily towards a service road in at the back.
