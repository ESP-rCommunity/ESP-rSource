Client: ESRU internal model
Project reference: 
Models created to show compliance with the UK National Calculation
Methodology. Model demonstrates cases 1, 2, 7 and 9 for dynamic
simulation modelling tools in order to qualify for accreditation to
issue Energy Performance Certificates.


Notes: 
The cfg folder contains the following model files:

Case 1 - Small shallow plan office heated with natural ventilation set
up to emulate the notional building

shal_plan_office_nv.cfg
________________________________________________________________________

Case 2 - same as case 1 but with mechanical ventilation 

shal_plan_office_mv.cfg
(points to different ncm file)
________________________________________________________________________

Case 7 - same as case 1 but with photovoltaic panels and biomass boilers

shal_plan_office_pv.cfg
(points to different ncm file)
________________________________________________________________________

Case 9 - same geometry as case 1 but set up to emulate the reference
building.

shal_plan_office_ref.cfg
(points to different geo, con and tmc files)

RESULTS FILES:
Results from running BRUKL and EPCGen on the input files are contained
in the folder aft_DOS
