Synopsis
 
This is a synopsis of the model supermarket sales with PV on roof defined in
Supermarket_2008_a_pv.cfg generated on Thu Feb 16 09:41:55 2012. Notes
associated with the model are in ../doc/SMsales.log
 
The model is located at latitude   52.00 with a longitude difference of   0.00
from the local time meridian. The year used in simulations is 2005 and
weekends occur on Saturday and Sunday.
The site exposure is typical city centre and the ground reflectance is 0.20.
