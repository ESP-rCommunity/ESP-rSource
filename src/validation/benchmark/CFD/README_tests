DESCRIPTION OF THE TESTS:
=========================

ISOTHERMAL TESTS & TESTS NOT INFLUENCING THE VELOCITY FILED 
===========================================================

1.     basic.dfd - Basic test case. Many other cases are a variation of it. 
                   Isothermal mixing ventilation, k-eps model, no blockages, 
                   no conflations, one inflow at west, one outflow at upper 
                   wall, no sources, stationary, default solver, 3D.  

2.     block.dfd - "Basic" with 3 blockages - middle, corner, two-wall-adjacent 
                   (top-wall). 

3.    block2.dfd - Like "Block.dfd", but two of the blockages forming a 
                   narrow channel in front of the air-supply-jet. Needs lower 
                   underrelaxation factors. 

4.    block3.dfd - Like "Block2.dfd", but the two plates are now perpendicular 
                   to the air-supply jet. Very low underrelaxation factors 
                   required. 

5.    blockc.dfd - "Basic" + blockages and CO2 concentration.

6.    blockh.dfd - "Basic" + blockages and humidity.

7.  blocklma.dfd - "Basic" + blockages and LMA calculated
                   (one of them quite enlarged to get areas of poor LMA).  

8.  basiclma.dfd - "Basic" with calculation of the LMA at the end.

9.    co2_so.dfd - "Basic" with a CO2 source in the middle of room.

10.   hum_so.dfd - "Basic" with a humidity source in the middle of room.

11.      lma.dfd - "Basic" but inflow south, outflow east, with calculation 
                   of the LMA at the end (i.e. rotating axes). 

12.      sso.dfs - "Basic" + small supply orifices test.

13.      tm1.dfd - "Basic" + the most simple non-isothermal case - no coupling 
                   with velocity field, inflow 25C, outflow 20C, initial 
                   temperature 15C, no sources, all walls adiabatic.  

14.   porous.dfd - Like "Block3.dfd", but now the first plate is made like a 
                   porous media. The second plate has been removed. Test for a 
                   large number of blockages. 

15. basicsol.dfd - "Basic" but inflow low, outflow north (i.e. rotating axes) 
                   and used for testing advanced (bi-cg) solver. 

21. tst33vol.dfd - "Basic" but with 33 (large number) different boundary 
                   conditions.

25.    bi-cg.dfd - A room with about 25 000 control volumes which converges 
                   to test the basic solver.

26.    bi-cg.dfd - A room with about 25 000 control volumes which converges 
                   to test the bi-conjugate gradients solver.

xx. hugegrid.dfd - A test for 100 iterations with about 330000 control volumes
                   (requires dfs to be recompiled for larger domain size). 



NON-ISOTHERMAL TESTS INFLUENCING THE VELOCITY FILED 
===================================================

16.    displ.dfd - "Tm1a.dfd" with heat flux at one wall, fixed temperature at  
                   the second, GGDH (General Gradient Diffusion Hypothesis), 
                   full t-v-coupling. 

17.    displ.dfd - "Tm1a.dfd" with heat flux at one wall, fixed temperature at  
                   the second, SGDH (Single Gradient Diffusion Hypothesis), 
                   full t-v-coupling. 

18. displ_si.dfd - "Displ.dfd", but the temperature sources are turned into 
                   sinks. 

19.   tm1_so.dfd - "Basic" with a heat sink in the middle of room, full
                   t-v-coupling.

20.   tm2_so.dfd - "Basic" with a heat source in the middle of room, 
                   Boussinesque t-v-coupling.

22.     tm1a.dfd - "Tm1.dfd", but with full t-v (temperature-velocity) coupling.

23.     tm1b.dfd - "Tm1.dfd", but with Boussinesque approximation. Different 
                   inflow and initial temperatures (as well as urf's) are
                   needed to converge.  

24.   blockt.dfd - "Block.dfd", heat flux at all three of them, SGDH, full t-v. 

27. dispggdh.dfd - "Displ.dfd", but with GGDH.  



PARAMETERS VARIED IN THE TESTS:
===============================
1.    Inflow and outflow positioned at different walls. 
2.    Adding sources which do not influence velocity field: 
      temperature, humidity, CO2 sources. 
3.    Testing blockages. 
4.    Fixed temperature at the walls or fixed heat flux at the walls. 
5.    Isothermal or fixed heat flux conditions at blockages. 
6.    Different types of gridding - rotation of axes. 
7.    Different buoyancy types - full or Boussinesque. 
8.    With GGDH or with SGDH (displacement ventilation). 
9.    Heat sources as well as heat sinks in the middle of the room. 
10.   Heat sources as well as heat sinks at the walls. 
11.   With or without LMAge. 
12.   Different solvers for the linear set of equations. 
13.   Small Supply Orifices. 


PROCEDURE:
==========

To run the tests execute the shell scripts TEST.csh and answer the 
questions.  The scripts will run each of the above tests, producing 
a .mon, .time and .TEC file.  The contents of the .mon and .TEC files 
should be approximately the same as those in the corresponding files 
in the Archive folder (the final results produced will be slightly 
different on different operating systems).  The script TECdiff.csh 
will check the differences between the .TEC files and those in the 
supplied folder.

The .time files are for developers to check that they have not 
adversly effected the running time of the module.

To check results against archival version run the script TEC_checker.csh
in the Models folder.
