VALIDATION OF ESP-r CFD CODE DEVELOPMENTS
*****************************************

TO UPDATE YOUR ARCHIVE:
=======================
The results distributed within standard ESP-r distribution may not be
appropriate for your machine type and / or operating system. Therefore
it is good practice to generate your own, as follows:

cd to folder validation/benchmark/CFD

run the script TEST.csh
The script asks for location of dfs executable, accept default (usually
/usr/esru/esp-r/bin/dfs)
This script runs a number of dfs standalone simulations placing results
files (*.mon,*.out,*.TEC,*.time) in the validation/benchmark/Models 
folder. Once the script has run (which may take a substanitial time)
move the results file to the Archive folder. (The folder contains
results file but these are probably different from the ones that your
machine/OS will generate). These results will be the standard results
against which the development version is to be checked.

TO CREATE DEVELOPMENT RESULTS:
==============================
Once standard results are obtained you need to get development version
results, as follows:

run the script TEST.csh again but this time specify the path to
development dfs executible instead of default. This will generate
results files in the Models directory.

TO COMPARE RESULTS:
===================

run the script TEC_checker.csh in the Models directory and give the name
of the Archive folder as argument. It is assumed that standard results
are present in the Archive and development results are present in the
Models folder. 
Once the script has run detailed results are available in CFD_res.text
and summary results are available in file CFD_summary.text 
It is advisable to look into summary results before delving into
detailed results.

TO CLEANUP:
===========

run the script tidy.csh in the Models folder. This removes all results
files from the Models folder but retains these in the Archive folder. 
You may optionally want to remove the files CFD_res.text and
CFD_summary.text from this folder. This is presently not supported.

If you want to remove archived results then issue the command 
rm -f *.mon *.time *.out *.TEC 
from that folder. 


DESCRIPTION OF THE TESTS:
=========================

ISOTHERMAL TESTS & TESTS NOT INFLUENCING THE VELOCITY FILED 
===========================================================

1.     basic.dfd - Basic test case. Many other cases are a variation of it. 
                   Isothermal mixing ventilation, k-eps model, no blockages, 
                   no conflations, one inflow at west, one outflow at upper 
                   wall, no sources, stationary, default solver, 3D.  

2.     block.dfd - "Basic" with 3 blockages - middle, corner, two-wall-adjacent 
                   (top-wall). 

3.    block2.dfd - Like "Block.dfd", but two of the blockages forming a 
                   narrow channel in front of the air-supply-jet. Needs lower 
                   underrelaxation factors. 

4.    block3.dfd - Like "Block2.dfd", but the two plates are now perpendicular 
                   to the air-supply jet. Very low underrelaxation factors 
                   required. 

5.    blockc.dfd - "Basic" + blockages and CO2 concentration.

6.    blockh.dfd - "Basic" + blockages and humidity.

7.  blocklma.dfd - "Basic" + blockages and LMA calculated
                   (one of them quite enlarged to get areas of poor LMA).  

8.  basiclma.dfd - "Basic" with calculation of the LMA at the end.

9.    co2_so.dfd - "Basic" with a CO2 source in the middle of room.

10.   hum_so.dfd - "Basic" with a humidity source in the middle of room.

11.      lma.dfd - "Basic" but inflow south, outflow east, with calculation 
                   of the LMA at the end (i.e. rotating axes). 

12.      sso.dfs - "Basic" + small supply orifices test.

13.      tm1.dfd - "Basic" + the most simple non-isothermal case - no coupling 
                   with velocity field, inflow 25C, outflow 20C, initial 
                   temperature 15C, no sources, all walls adiabatic.  

14.   porous.dfd - Like "Block3.dfd", but now the first plate is made like a 
                   porous media. The second plate has been removed. Test for a 
                   large number of blockages. 

15. basicsol.dfd - "Basic" but inflow low, outflow north (i.e. rotating axes) 
                   and used for testing advanced (bi-cg) solver. 

21. tst33vol.dfd - "Basic" but with 33 (large number) different boundary 
                   conditions.

25.    bi-cg.dfd - A room with about 25 000 control volumes which converges 
                   to test the basic solver.

26.    bi-cg.dfd - A room with about 25 000 control volumes which converges 
                   to test the bi-conjugate gradients solver.

xx. hugegrid.dfd - A test for 100 iterations with about 330000 control volumes
                   (requires dfs to be recompiled for larger domain size). 



NON-ISOTHERMAL TESTS INFLUENCING THE VELOCITY FILED 
===================================================

16.    displ.dfd - "Tm1a.dfd" with heat flux at one wall, fixed temperature at  
                   the second, GGDH (General Gradient Diffusion Hypothesis), 
                   full t-v-coupling. 

17.    displ.dfd - "Tm1a.dfd" with heat flux at one wall, fixed temperature at  
                   the second, SGDH (Single Gradient Diffusion Hypothesis), 
                   full t-v-coupling. 

18. displ_si.dfd - "Displ.dfd", but the temperature sources are turned into 
                   sinks. 

19.   tm1_so.dfd - "Basic" with a heat sink in the middle of room, full

23.     tm1b.dfd - "Tm1.dfd", but with Boussinesque approximation. Different 
                   inflow and initial temperatures (as well as urf's) are
                   needed to converge.  

24.   blockt.dfd - "Block.dfd", heat flux at all three of them, SGDH, full t-v.

13.   Small Supply Orifices. 


PROCEDURE:
==========

Following is an paraphrased version of the steps given at the start 
of this document.

To run the tests execute the shell scripts TEST.csh and answer the 
questions.  The scripts will run each of the above tests, producing 
a .mon, .time and .TEC file.  The contents of the .mon and .TEC files 
should be approximately the same as those in the corresponding files 
in the Archive folder (the final results produced will be slightly 
different on different operating systems).  The script TECdiff.csh 
will check the differences between the .TEC files and those in the 
supplied folder.

The .time files are for developers to check that they have not 
adversly effected the running time of the module.
