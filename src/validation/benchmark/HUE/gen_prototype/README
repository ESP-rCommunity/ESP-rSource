This document provides informatino about how to generate prototypes, 
simulate these using various climate files and generate regression
equations quantifying their thermal performance.

1. Registering prototypes:
Run the program 01.proto_reg to register prototypes. This makes a large
number of ESP-r configuration files

2. Generate prototypes:
Run the program 02.proto_gen to generate prototypes. This makes
supporting zones files

3. Simulate prototypes:
Run the program 03.proto_sim to simulate the prototypes. An alternate
program called 03.proto_sim_pp exists in the src folder for running
simulations on a parallel processing super computer environment. This 
program was developed for use on the University of Strathclyde high 
performance computer details of which can be found at
http://use-hpc.eng.strath.ac.uk

4. Generate regression equations:
Run the program 04.MLR_eqn_gen to generate regression equations for
monthly energy performance of each prototype. This is a fortran program
that should be compiled from the source file 04.MLR_eqn_gen.F in the
src folder.

5. Cleanup:
Run the program 05.cleanup to clean up all the files created during the
above process.
