This folder contains the folders UKCP_weather and ESP-r_weather

UKCP_weather contains weather files sourced from the UKCP09 project for
historic weather data. These files are generated by the UKCP weather
generator software. This is available after registering for UKCP09 at 
http://ukclimateprojections-ui.defra.gov.uk/ui/admin/login.php
The files are in csv format.

The UKCP_weather folder also contains the program ESP-r_weather_gen. 
This program transforms the UKCP09 csv weather files into ESP-r format.

Once generated the ESP-r ascii weather files should be moved to the 
folder ESP-r_weather. These files are named as 
uk_SAPP_[descriptive_string].clm.a e.g. uk_SAPP_Borders.clm.a
