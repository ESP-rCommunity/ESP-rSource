Notes on basic 3 zone building with external shading, and
convective heating of the reception and office (under ideal control):

This set of files is an example of a basic multi-zone
building  representation, with external shading.
Shading has been established for all exterior surfaces
in the reception for the year and insolation distribution
has been calculated for the contribution of the windows.

The problem comprises the following files.

    file                       description
____________________________________________________________
cfg/bld_basic_shd_lwv.cfg    problem configuration file defining a
                             3 zone model with shading and explicit
                             longwave radiation exchange.
ctl/bld_basic.ctl            configuration control file defining convective
                             heating and ideal control for zones 1 & 2.
