Notes on basic 3 zone building with external shading, explicit
longwave radiation exchange and convective heating of zones
1 & 2 (under ideal control):

This set of files is an example of a basic multi-zone
building  representation, with external shading and explicit
longwave radiation exchange superimposed on one zone.
Shading has been established for the reception sufaces
south, west, glz_s & door_w for the period January
through December inclusive.  The  model is made
more detailed  by replacing the default area-weighted
viewfactors in the reception with  viewfactors calculated
by ESP-r's ray-tracing method.

The problem comprises the following files.
