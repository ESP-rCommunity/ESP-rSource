Notes on basic 3 zone building with explicit infiltration:

This set of files is an example of a basic multi-zone
building  representation with an air flow network, representing
infiltration, superimposed.  The infiltration network
comprises flows via cracks under doors and around windows
and soffit and ridge vents in the roof space.

The problem comprises the following files.

    file                       description
____________________________________________________________
cfg/bld_basic_af1.cfg    problem configuration file defining a basic
                         3 zone model with infiltration flow network.
ctl/bld_basic.ctl        configuration control file defining convective
                         heating and ideal control for zones 1 & 2.

zones/reception.opr      zone schedules.
zones/office.opr
zones/roof_space.opr

zones/reception.geo      zone geometry.
zones/office.geo
zones/roof_space.geo

zones/reception.con      zone constructions.
zones/office.con
zones/roof_space.con

zones/reception.tmc      zone TMC files.
zones/office.tmc

flows/bld_basic_af1.afn  infiltration network comprising 4 boundary
                         nodes (north, east, south, west) and 3 internal
                         nodes (roof, recep, offic) matching the thermal
                         zones.  Mass flow components (drcrk, wincrk,
                         soffit, roofv) define the flow restrictions. The
                         flow paths are between each zone and the outside
                         via window cracks and between the two occupied
                         rooms via a crack under the door.  The roof space
                         has two flow paths to the outside - one through
                         the soffit and one by way of the roof vent.
