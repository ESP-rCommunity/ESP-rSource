Notes: 
 
This 3BR detached house represents a 1930s age block and render
house in the far north of Scotland. It uses block walls for
partitions (as this was common at the time). Windows have
been upgraded to double glazing. A small single garage is
attached to the side.

For flexibility, each room of the dwelling has been
represented as well as spaces which are likely to be
at variant temperatures (under stairs, crawl space
and roof void). 

Activities:
p1m  people at work and careful with electrical use
p2m  one adult and child in during afternoons and careful with electrical use
p2h  one adult and child in during afternoons and profligate use of electricity

Controls:
cool assumes heating to 17 in bedrooms and 19 in living areas with no summer heat
avg assumes heating to 19 in bedrooms and 21 in living areas with no summer heat
warm assumes heating to 21 in bedrooms and 23 in living areas with some summer heating

Room operational types:
unoccupied but with infiltration - crawl garage roof_space storage
bedrooms p1m p2m p2h variants
study p1m p2m p2h variants
hall p1m p2m p2h variants (assumed to have a storage unit)
living p1m p2m p2h variants (assumed to have a storage unit)
kitchen p1m p2m p2h variants
kitchen_liv p1m p2m p2h variants (assumed to have a storage unit)

3BR_block_bungalow.cfg - minimally attributed model on which further
  variants can be created.
3BR_block_bungalow_p1m_avg.cfg - activity p1m with average comfort
3BR_block_bungalow_p1m_cool.cfg - activity p1m with cool comfort
3BR_block_bungalow_p1m_warm.cfg - activity p1m with warm comfort
3BR_block_bungalow_p2h_avg.cfg - activity p2h with average comfort
3BR_block_bungalow_p2h_cool.cfg - activity p2h with cool comfort
3BR_block_bungalow_p2h_warm.cfg - activity p2h with warm comfirt
3BR_block_bungalow_p2m.cfg - general model without zone operations
3BR_block_bungalow_p2m_avg.cfg - activity p2m with average comfort
3BR_block_bungalow_p2m_cool.cfg - activity p2m with cool comfort
3BR_block_bungalow_p2m_warm.cfg - activity p2m with warm comfort

Each model (except 3BR_block_bungalow.cfg and 3BR_block_bungalow_p2m.cfg)
have IPv definitions and have been test simulated one week in each
season.
