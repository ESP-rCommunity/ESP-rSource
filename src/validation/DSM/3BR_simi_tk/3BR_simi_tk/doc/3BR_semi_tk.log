Notes: 
 
This 3BR simi detached house was taken from plans and 
represents timber-kit construction which is typcial of 
o1970s building standards in the far north of Scotland.
Infiltration is slightly higher to reflect the age of
the building. Some rooms assume window opening if temperatures
rise.

For flexibility, each room of the dwelling has been
represented as well as spaces which are likely to be
at variant temperatures (under stairs, crawl space
and roof void).

Model variants in this folder:

Activities:
p1m  people at work and careful with electrical use
p2m  one adult and child in during afternoons and careful with electrical use
p2h  one adult and child in during afternoons and profligate use of electricity

Controls:
