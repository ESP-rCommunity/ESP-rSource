Notes on the office model
Updated on November 7 2006.

office_bc.cfg and office_bcX.cfg are the two
configuration files. Zone operations are
used to represent infiltration and ventilation.

the configuration file office_afn.cfg is not
quite complete and needs further work.

On 22 Nov 2005 noticed that roof space had no
infiltration - changed this to 0.5 ach 24/7.

On 23 Nov 2005 noticed that Duluth didn't have
sufficient heating capacity so created
a 'north' version of control with 40kW
of heating per zone. This corrected the
problem. 

Noticed that Fairbanks required even
more heating capacity...

Current QA reports are in the doc folder.

Current performance predictions are to be placed
in the reports folder.

Updated for diversified occupancy in July 2006.

The following scripts are included - 

manage_shd.csh does several tasks including creating
QA reports for each model variant, forcing a recalculation
of shading files for each city (used if moving between
computers). This was tested in Nov 2006 for creating
QA reports and re-calculating shading.

mod_cp.csh is used when initially setting up a model when
the initial case model is correct and ready to be replicated
to different cities. The script is intended to update the
site information, the shading files, the titles in the
model and the integrated performance view text. It relies
mostly on the facilities in 'make-me-a-variant'. Note that
mod_cp.csh needs to be edited to match the name of the
initial model file and, because it gets copied from place
to place and there are slight changes in the ESP-r interface
the one in this folder has not been checked.

run_assessments.csh is a script to perform a sequence of
weekly or seasonal assessments for one or more of the
cities. In the weekly mode it uses information in the 
integrated performance view to run 5 assessments and scale 
the information to an annual values.  In seasonal mode
(assuming there are variants of the model configuration files
which are setup with simulation parameters which include
every day of the season) it runs 5 assessments with a scaling
factor of one. This is useful for models which are large or
need short timesteps and would otherwise produce huge
results files which are slow to scan.  This script has
a foreach in it that includes the names of the cities
to be run and this needs to be edited to suit the current
needs.  I tend to run one or two cities and check the
results. Note the current file is setup to remove all the
results files (except for winter run) and only keep a *.stats 
file and an IPV report.  Tested this for chicago on 7 November 2006.
