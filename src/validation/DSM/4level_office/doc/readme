_____________________________

A four level shallow plan office building which includes core
zones at each level, the ground and 1st level are low resolution,
the 2nd level is subdivided by orientation and the upper level
is again, lower resolution. Ceiling voids are treated explicitly
as is the roof space.

There are two zones representing mixing boxes but they are
place holders for variants which use flow networks to represent
a slightly temperated fresh air supply.

Variant office_4l_ves.cfg includes a vestibule to reduce heat
exchange between the entrance and ground level core.

Variant office_4l_cgc.cfg imposes lighting casual gain control
on the open plan offices and top level offices base on Daylight
Factor calculations done in Radiance.

Variant office_4l_fin.cfg includes a number of shading fins on
the facade in order to limit summer overheating.

Variant office_4l_bc does not include the shading or the vestibule.

There are several scripts included in the model cfg folder. These
were created in an earlier project and are not yet operational. They
are intended to support parametric assessments which shift the model
to different cities.  Here are the earlier notes on the scripts:

::manage_shd.csh does several tasks including creating
QA reports for each model variant, forcing a recalculation
of shading files for each city (used if moving between
computers). This was tested in Nov 2006 for creating
QA reports and re-calculating shading.

::mod_cp.csh is used when initially setting up a model when
the initial case model is correct and ready to be replicated
to different cities. The script is intended to update the
site information, the shading files, the titles in the
model and the integrated performance view text. It relies
mostly on the facilities in 'make-me-a-variant'. Note that
mod_cp.csh needs to be edited to match the name of the
initial model file and, because it gets copied from place
to place and there are slight changes in the ESP-r interface
the one in this folder has not been checked.

::run_assessments.csh is a script to perform a sequence of
weekly or seasonal assessments for one or more of the
cities. In the weekly mode it uses information in the 
integrated performance view to run 5 assessments and scale 
the information to an annual values.  In seasonal mode
(assuming there are variants of the model configuration files
which are setup with simulation parameters which include
every day of the season) it runs 5 assessments with a scaling
factor of one. This is useful for models which are large or
need short timesteps and would otherwise produce huge
results files which are slow to scan.  This script has
a foreach in it that includes the names of the cities
to be run and this needs to be edited to suit the current
needs.  I tend to run one or two cities and check the
results. Note the current file is setup to remove all the
results files (except for winter run) and only keep a *.stats 
file and an IPV report.  Tested this for chicago on 7 November 2006.
