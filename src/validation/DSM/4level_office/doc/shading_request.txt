I am looking for a rough cost estimate on adding external
shading devices to an existing brick-clad 4 level
office building - say 4500m^2. I need rough cost
for the devices and for installation to support
a cost-benefit analysis for an IEA Annex project.

The type of shading devices I have in mind are
stainless steel brackets projecting about 750mm
on ~2m centres with fixed louvres between. Commercial
quality and assuming that it is possible to attach
to steel framing behind the brick.

There is a parallel question about vertical side-fins
of the same construction standard.

The pricing could be per linear metre of the device
and for installing a linear metre (but if you have
figures in per m^2 that would work). 

Any help you could give in terms of numbers
or contact details would be appreciated.
