Notes: 
 
This 3BR simi detached house was taken from plans and 
represents timber-kit construction which is in advance 
of late 1990s building standards in the far north of Scotland. 

For flexibility, each room of the dwelling has been
represented as well as spaces which are likely to be
at variant temperatures (under stairs, crawl space
and roof void).

The building construction is assumed to be tighter
than normal in terms of infiltration.
Model variants in this folder:

Activities:
p1m  people at work and careful with electrical use
p2m  one adult and child in during afternoons and careful with electrical use
p2h  one adult and child in during afternoons and profligate use of electricity

Controls:
cool assumes heating to 17 in bedrooms and 19 in living areas with no summer heat
avg assumes heating to 19 in bedrooms and 21 in living areas with no summer heat
warm assumes heating to 21 in bedrooms and 23 in living areas with some summer heating
