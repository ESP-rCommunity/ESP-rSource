Notes: 
This model is typical of an 1890s north of Scotland
traditional stone villa which has not been upgraded
from its original construction types. It has single
glazed windows, stone walls up to 900mm thick and
masonry walls inside.

The model includes a slightly ventilated crawl-space
and a slightly ventilated roof void.

Environmental controls are based on radiators in each
room (mixed R+C sensor mixed R+C actuator) with some
diversity of use.
