Notes: 

This is one half of a four unit dwelling (a lower one BR
flat and an upper one BR flat).  Its composition is representative
of timber-kit energy efficient public housing in the late
1990s in the North of Scotland.

Each room is explicitly represented as is the roof space 
and the crawl space. This allows transient occupancy patterns
to be studied as well as the impact on different infiltration
regimes.

Model variants in this folder:

Activities:
p1m  people at work and careful with electrical use
p2m  one adult in during afternoons and careful with electrical use
p2h  one adult in during afternoons and profligate use of electricity

Controls:
cool assumes heating to 17 in bedrooms and 19 in living areas with no summer heat
avg assumes heating to 19 in bedrooms and 21 in living areas with no summer heat
warm assumes heating to 21 in bedrooms and 23 in living areas with some summer heating

Room operational types:
unoccupied but with infiltration - crawl garage roof_space storage
bedrooms p1m p2m p2h variants
study p1m p2m p2h variants
hall p1m p2m p2h variants (assumed to have a storage unit)
living p1m p2m p2h variants (assumed to have a storage unit)
kitchen p1m p2m p2h variants
kitchen_liv p1m p2m p2h variants (assumed to have a storage unit)

1BR_4in_block.cfg - minimally attributed model on which further
  variants can be created.
