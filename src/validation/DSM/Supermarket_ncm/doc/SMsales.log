This model approximates a retail box shed supermarket in the
UK with 2008 standard constructions.  There is diversity in
the internal gains. The public spaces are represented as a
foyer (with air mixing to the outside), main shop (with
internal mass of shelfs included), refrigerated section within
which is an abstract low temperature chilled cabinet and a
standard chilled cabinet (air is mixed with the cabinets to
approximate people accessing the cabinets).

There is a cafe on the right of the foyer and a newstand
and office on the left. The upper level includes an
office and a staff room with a passage connecting them.

The service areas at the back of the building include a
double height shipping and receiving area and storage
space for goods in transet and a small cold storage room.

Because of the large number of people that might be in the
building make-up air (6l/s/p) is passed through a tempered mixing
box (16C). The make-up air rate is reduced overnight. 

There are several models:
Supermarket_2008.cfg - a standard model
Supermarket_2008_ann.cfg - standard model for assessing all-days all-seasons
Supermarket_2008_ncm.cfg - with additional attribution for code checks
Supermarket_2008_pv.cfg - with a large PV array added to sales roof
Supermarket_2008_a_pv.cfg - ditto but assesses all-days all-seasons
Supermarket_2008_ann_pv_r6.cfg ditto after calibration phase to adjust
  lighting loads and small power as per the TARBASE database from
  Napier University as well as adjusting fresh air rates and support
  area casual gains to reflect occupancy patterns.

The Supermarket_2008_ncm.cfg includes a UK NCM description so that 
complience assessments can be carried out.  Note: you manually have
to remove the flow control definition from the control file prior
to runing the NCM assessments.

The model is work-in-progress. The variant Supermarket_2008_ann_pv_r6.cfg
can be used to compare performance with PV after the building description
and use patterns have evolved.

Note: in order to use the model the ../dbs/Supermarket.climate.a weather
file must be converted from ASCII to binary via the clm module of ESP-r.
