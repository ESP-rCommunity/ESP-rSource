Notes: 

This is a small one BR bungalow. It has an attached entry
and storage area.  Its composition is representative
of timber energy efficient public housing in the late
1990s in the North of Scotland.

Each room is explicitly represented as is the roof space 
and the crawl space. This allows transient occupancy patterns
to be studied as well as the impact on different infiltration
regimes. Infiltration control is used if overheating is
detected.

Activities:
p1m  people at work and careful with electrical use

Controls:
cool assumes heating to 17 in bedrooms and 19 in living areas with no summer heat
avg assumes heating to 19 in bedrooms and 21 in living areas with no summer heat
warm assumes heating to 21 in bedrooms and 23 in living areas with some summer heating
