 4  # number of classifications
#  
# Materials have the following attributes:
#  conductivity (W/(m-K), density (kg/m**3) specific heat (J/(kg-K)
#  emissivity out (-) emissivity in (-)#   absorptivity out (-) absorptivity in (-)
#  diffusion resistance (MNs g^-1m^-1)
#  default thickness (mm)
#  flag [-] legacy [o] opaque [t] transparent
#       [g] gas or air gap
#  
# Transparent material additonal attributes:
#  longwave tran (-) solar direct tran (-) solar reflec out (-) solar refled in (-)
#  visable tran (-) visable reflec out (-) visable reflec in (-) colour rendering (-)
#  
# Gas material additional attributes:
#  air gap resistance for vert horiz other
