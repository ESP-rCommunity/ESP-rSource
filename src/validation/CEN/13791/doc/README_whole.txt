Notes on files for CEN summer temperature standard: 
prEN ISO 13791 Draft of June 1995. 
Whole model validation tests.

The script SIMULATE will run the simulation of the two models 
once the source code has been recompiled and the location 
of the new bps is provided in the script.

Details of the model are in the report (Macdonald 1997).  

The source code modifications are as follows:
1) vertical radiation reads in two items (time and radiation)
   to facilitate checking of timings

2) Definition of adiabatic adjusted - use standard ESP-r defn. 
   for dynamic boundary and set external shortwave to 
   equal internal.  (Original code lost during conversion 
   for cooling load standard which required a different 
   interpretation of adiabatic).

2005 NOTES

Ventilation source not identified (assumed to be ambient air)

Tables 15 a and b all columns titled 'direct' - surely a mistake.

Changed infiltration rates to account for lower air capacity in standard 
(compared to ESP-r default value).
