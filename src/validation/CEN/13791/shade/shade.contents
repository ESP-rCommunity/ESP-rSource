Synopsis
 
This is a synopsis of the model Calculate shading for June only defined in
shade.cfg generated on Thu Oct 15 22:18:46 2009. Notes associated with the
model are in job.notes
 
The model is located at latitude   52.00 with a longitude difference of  -0.50
from the local time meridian. The year used in simulations is 2000 and
weekends occur on Saturday and Sunday.
The site exposure is typical city centre and the ground reflectance is 0.00.
