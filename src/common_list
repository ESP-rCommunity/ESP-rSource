C Notes on common blocks found in ESP-r
C This text file includes a substantial list of the
C data structures found in ESP-r as well as notes on
C the variables included in the common blocks.

C This file is `work in progress` and some data
C structures have not yet been documented. Anyone
C wishing to extend the list should follow the
C following conventions:

C a) common blocks are listed in alphabetical order

C b) each common block is preceeded by a key phrase
C    in the form of `C DOCUMENT XX` where XX is the
C    name of the common block (e.g. the text between
C    the / / marks. The key phrase is a Fortran comment
C    line so this common_list file can, if required be
C    compiled and linked into an ESP-r executable for
C    purposes of syntax checking.

C c) each common block is followed by one or more lines
C    of Fortran comment lines documenting the data
C    structure. Typically, string variables have (12 char)
C    written after the variable name and logical variables
C    have (logical) written after the variable name (and
C    before any notes. This suports the use of `grep` searches.

C d) each key phrase is preceeded by two blank lines
C    (to separate the data structures).

C e) this file should be placed at the top level of the
C    ESP-r source tree (i.e. /usr/esru/Src/esp-r)

C About the documentation of common block variables in
C ESP-r. The general pattern is to document common block
C variables at least one location within the source code.
C For variables held in the model files, the documentation
C is placed in the subroutine that reads the file. This
C common_list file uses notes extracted from the source
C distribution.

C If possible, updates and corrections to common blocks and
C documentation in the source code should also be included
C in this file.
