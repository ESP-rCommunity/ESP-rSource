'The optimum start controller allows for three modes '
'of operation: '
' (1) Default start at 4AM'

'     A New Optimum Start Control Algorithm in Proceedings'
'     of International Symposium on Control and Operation'
'     of Building HVAC Systems in 1985 Trondheim, Norway'
' '
'Note this control is designed for optimum start of heating only.'
'It is one of the lesser used controls - pay attention to the'
'predicted performance.'
' '
'Heating capacity is in W to be used during the optimum startup'
'period. '
' '
'The heating setpoint (C) is the desired temperature at the'
'desired-time-of-arrival. '
' '
'The band of acceptable temperatures (C) is applied to the heating'
'setpoint to provide an upper and lower setpoints. A small band'
'will force tighter control.'
' '
'If the optimal control does not reach the band of acceptable'
'temperature at the desired-time-of-arrival then it will rewind'
'and try again. You can control the time difference between'
'successive trails by setting a minimum-time-difference. '
' '
'The Birtles & John Eqn. asks for three coefficients - the first'
'is a heating constant, the second is a building constant and the'
'third is an exterior temperature constant. Please review the paper'
'in order to understand these coefficients. '

'Proportional capacity slave controller. Typically a slave control'
'is used to represent an environmental control with a thermostat in'
'one zone and actions in other zones.'
'  '
' Example: a residentail AC system with a central fan delivering'
' to several zones.'
' '
'Flux is delivered to slave control when required by the master'
'control, at same % of base (max) capacity.'
' '
'You are asked for three values:'
'  - index of control loop associated with the master control'
'    (which MUST use a basic ideal controller or a free float'
'    control and the master MUST also sense a specific zone in'
'    the model).'
' '
'  - base (maximum) heating capacity for slave'
'  - base (maximum  cooling capacity for slave.'
' '
'Procedure - first create the master control loop and then create'
'a slave loop for each other zones in the model which are to act'
'as slaves. If the master control loop is for particular day types'
'e.g. weekday Saturday Sunday then each slave control should follow'
'this pattern and the number of periods should also match. '
' '
'The sensor of each slave controller MUST point to the SAME zone'
'that the master controller senses.'
' '
'The actuator of each slave controller MUST point to the slave zone.'
' '
'The simulation timestep should typically be short enough to reflect'
'the cycling of the environmental control system. '
' '
'Example: in a house there is 4kW of heating and the thermostat is'
'in the lounge which has 1kW of heating so the slave capacity in'
'the other zones should total to 3kW. Setting the capacity in each'
'slave zone can be done via different methods:'
' a) as a proportion of the duct flow or radiator size in each'
'    slave zone'
' b) by doing an initial simulation with each zone ideally controlled'
'    and noticing the ratio of the peak demands in each room'

'reach the desired setpoint.'

'is able to meet demand patterns in a room prior to specification'
'of a detailed component model. If flow rates or supply temperature'
'are not well sepecified then the room temperature will drift '
'as expected. '
' '
'Specification of minimum flow rate is a compromise between what is'
'required for CAV heating and excess cooling in low-load conditions.'
' '
'Typically the maximum flow rate would be equivalent to 12-20 ach'

'  or the pressure varies. You will be asked for the gauge'
'  pressure in  Pa.'

'boundary:known - a node describing conditions at the '

'  this type of node is infrequently used. You will be asked'
'  for the gauge pressure in  Pa as well as a constant'
'  temperature at the node or a choice of ambient temperature.'
' '
'boundary:wind induced - another node describing the conditions'
'  at the boundary of the network. In this case the pressure of'
'  this node is generated by wind impinging upon a surface. The'
'  pressure is a function of wind velocity, wind direction and a'
'  pressure coefficient, Cp, (assigned based on the orientation'
