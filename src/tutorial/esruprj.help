*item EBCNTRL sys_bctl_multi_sensor
'A multi-sensor control is used to inject/extract heat in one zone'
'(termed source) based on conditions in other locations (termed'
'auxilliary sensors).'
' '
'If any of the auxilliary sensors demands heat then heat will be'
'injected in the source zone. For cooling heat will be extracted'
'from the source. If there are simultaneous demands for heating'
'and cooling nothing will happen.'
' '
'A classic use is to condition a mixing box/air handler used'
'within an air flow network to deliver heating or cooling to'
'an occupied space. '
' '
'If you are using a multi-sensor controller to enable a chilled'
'ceiling (represented as a zone) or a radiant heating panel'
'or a Korean Ondol thin floor heater (represented as a zone)'
'then these set  points are the temperature of the working fluid in'
'the radiant panel. Later you will be asked for the set points'
'for the occupied space(s). '
' '
'If you do not wish cooling use a high set point such as 100C'
'A 0 deg C cooling setpoint does not turn cooling off. '
' '
'Example: to heat a radiant panel to 70C in order to get a'
'temperature of 21C in adjacent room(s).'
' '
'Heat delivery may be less than the max. If minimium'
'heating > 0 then heating will continue at a reduced level'
'even when the setpoint is reached. If there is no cooling'
'then use zero values in conjunction with a high cooling setpoint.'
' '
'Note this type of control is an ON/OFF control and thus you'
'should use an appropriately short timestep of one or two minutes'
'if there is not much mass in the radiant panel or if there is a'
'considerable air air flow rate. '
' '
'Note: set the sensor at the air node rather than mixed rad/conv.'
' '
'Also for both heating and cooling panels it is common to inject'
'at the air node and to use a heat transfer coefficient regime '
'at the surfaces to ensure flux is transferred to the panel. '
'For a mixing box it is usually not necessary to use a hc regime.'
' '
'The aux sensor details are the usual 4 values:'
'  Example: to sense air temperature is 3rd zone'
'    3.0  0.0  0.0  0.0'
' '
'This data is followed - per sensor - by the heating set-point'
'and cooling set-point for that auxiliary sensor.'
' '
'Thus the number of control data items is thus 7 + 6 * no. of sensors'
' '
' Example: to sense air temperature in 3rd zone which'
'    needs to be heated to 21.1C and no cooling'
'    3.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 21.1 100.0 '

'checking the data/QA report afterwards.'

'The optimum start controller allows for three modes '
'of operation: '
' (1) Default start at 4AM'
' (2) Start at user defined time'
' (3) Birtles & John equationq estimate which is '
'     based on A New Optimum Start Control Algorithm'
'     in Proceedings of International Symposium'
'     on Control and Operation of Building HVAC'
'     Systems in 1985 Trondheim, Norway'
' '
'Note this control is designed for optimum start '
'of heating only. It is one of the lesser used '
'controls - pay attention to the predicted performance.'
' '
'Heating capacity is in W to be used during the'
'optimum startup period. '
' '
'The heating setpoint (C) is the desired temperature'
'at the desired-time-of-arrival. '
' '
'The band of acceptable temperatures (C) is applied'
'to the heating setpoint to provide an upper and '
'lower setpoints. A small band will force tighter'
'control. '
' '
'If the optimal control does not reach the band of'
'acceptable temps at the desired-time-of-arrival '
'then it will rewind and try again. You can control '
'the time difference between successive trails by '
'setting a minimum-time-difference. '
' '
'The Birtles & John Eqn. asks for three coefficients '
'the first is a heating constant, the second is a '
'building constant and the third is an exterior '
'temperature constant. Please review the paper '
'in order to understand these coefficients. '
' '
'This control uses a rewind action that resets the'

'Proportional capacity slave controller. Typically a'
'slave control is used to represent an environmental'
'control with a thermostat in one zone and actions in'
'a number of zones. Example: a residentail AC system'
'with a central fan delivering to several zones.'
' '
'Flux is delivered to slave control when required by'
'master control, at same % of base (max) capacity.'
' '
'You are asked for three values:'
'  - index of control loop associated with the'
'    master control (which MUST use a basic ideal'
'    controller or a free float control and the master'
'    MUST also sense a specific zone in the model).'
' '
'  - base (maximum) heating capacity for slave'
'  - base (maximum  cooling capacity for slave.'
' '
'Procedure - first create the master control loop'
'and then create a slave loop for each other zone'
'in the model which acts as a slave. If the master'
'control loop is for weekday Saturday Sunday then'
'each slave control should follow this pattern and'
'the number of periods should also match. '
' '
'The sensor of each slave controller MUST point to'
'the SAME zone that the master controller senses.'
' '
'The actuator of each slave controller MUST point to'
'the slave zone. '
' '
'The simulation timestep should typically be short '
'enough to reflect the cycling of the environmental'
'control system. '
' '
'Example: in a house there is 4kW of heating and the'
'thermostat is in the lounge which has 1kW of heating'
'so the slave capacity in the other zones should'
'total to 3kW. Setting the capacity in each slave'
'zone can be done via different methods:'
' a) as a proportion of the duct flow or radiator'
'    size in each zone'
' b) by doing an initial simulation with each zone'
'    ideally controlled and noticing the ratio of'
'    the peak demands in each room'

'This control represents an ideal air based '
'environmental control system that delivers air '

'for cooling to a desired setpoint.'
' '
'In heating mode it reverts to a CAV system at the'
'minimal supply flow rate with reheat applied up to a '
'maximum flux to reach the desired setpoint.'
' '
'There is a single desired room setpoint (C) so'
'the control law will cycle between VAV and CAV '
'model under low-load conditions. '
' '
'It is recommended that a short timestep be used with'
'this control ( 1 - 5 minutes). '
' '
'This control law can be used to check whether an '
'air based system is able to meet demand patterns in '
'a room prior to specification of a detailed component'
'model. If flow rates or supply temperature are not '
'well sepecified then the room temperature will drift '
'as expected. '
' '
'Specification of minimum flow rate is a compromise '
'between what is required for CAV heating and excess '
'cooling in low-load conditions. '
' '
'Typically the maximum flow rate would be equivalent '
'to 12-20ach in the zone. Low max flow rates can result'
'in failure to meet the desired temperature. And high'
'minimum flow rates can result in overcooling in mild '
'conditions. '

'    models and predictions.'
' '
' d) it is recommended that you plan your cfd domains first and'

'It includes descriptive information: title, version'
'and synopsis and one or more images. These can be'
'edited directly.'
' '
'Performance metrics (comfort, zone dry bulb temp, etc.)'
'are associated with a set of thermal zones and have'
'weighting factors (to assist in ranking performance).'
' '
'Demand sets are sets of zones for which heating, cooling'
'lighting, small power and DHW are reported. Each set'
'has a scaling factor so that, for example 2 offices'
'zones can be scaled to represent 15 offices.'
' '
'Annual performance is scaled from an annual run, three'
'seasonal runs: winter/transition/summer, or five runs:'
'1st winter/spring/summer/autumn/2nd winter. Each run '
'has date and heating and cooling degree day ratio '
'attributes. Periods can be setup based on a best-fit'
'scan of climate data (see option 5).'
' '
'Display days: are specific days (up to 10) for which'
'timestep data is recorded.'
' '
'Seasons are based on information in the [climatelist]'
'file. This information is included to clarify the'
'relationship between each season and the 1/3/5 sim-'
'ulations being run. '
' '
'Ratios: are typically ratios between the number of'
'days (or heating/cooling degree days) of the season'
'and the assessment period. For an annual simulation'
'the ratios are 1.00.'
' '
'Option 5 [re-scan climate] is a two step process;'
'the first to scan the [climatelist] file for the '
'days in each season; the second being scanning the'
'climate data to find the best fit week in each'
'season. '

'a) edit the title version and synopsis, '
'b) select relevant performance metrics for the project,'

'NODES - these are the calculation points in the network '
'and should be placed where conductors join, or where '
'loads or power sources connect to the network.'
'In multi-phase systems, multi-phase nodes are grouped'
'in phase-sets, one node of the set represents a phase.'
' '
'CONNECTING COMPONENTS - these convey electrical current'
'between the nodes in the network. They are impedance  '
'models of the distribution components in an electrical '
'system: lines, cables transformers. In addition to con-'
'veying power, the transformer component also changes the'
'voltage between two nodes.'
' '
'HVAC/PV/LIGHTS/EQUIPMENT and POWER-ONLY COMPONENTS - '
'these link into the network and either draw power '
'from or inject power into the network. HVAC components  '
'etc. are components which exist in other areas of your  '
'model, i.e. lighting loads a PV array or a fan. '
'Power-only components exist only in the electrical  '
'world e.g. a wind turbine or a diesel generator set.'
' '
'CONNECTIONS - these link the entire network together.'
'A connection links two or more nodes using a connecting'
'component, connections can be multi-phase, single-phase'
'd.c. or balanced. Single phase components can be used'
'in the connection of multi-phase sets of nodes but not'
'vice versa. Phase-set nodes can be linked to single '
'nodes, but only if the phase numbers of the connected '
'nodes match. An a.c. to d.c. connection is possible,'
'but only with AC/DC conversion devices.'
' '
'The complete NETWORK consists of all the above elements'
'connected together. Other information required includes'
'the type of network: a.c., d.c., mixed or balanced plus'
'BASE VALUES of voltage and power. These are needed as'
'network solution is done in PER UNIT notation. Voltage '

 '(EPC_ Make sure that the original model follows the'
 'following assumptions: '
 '1. Exterior surfaces that have other surfaces within them'
 '   are called parents. Parents may have more surfaces '
 '   within them. Only a three tier hierarchy is allowed '
 '   i.e. only parent, child and grandchild are allowed '
 '   e.g. a wall with a frame and a window). '
 '  '
 '2. Each exterior surface needs to have a usage. You will'
 '   be asked to provide it if not already defined in the'
 '   geometry and attributions menu.'
 '  '
 '   Only the following usages can be associated with '
 '   exterior surfaces that are parents: '
 '   - if exterior & vertical & opaque = WALL '
 '   - if exterior & horiz UP & opaque = ROOF FLAT'
 '   - if exterior & horiz DOWN & opaque = not allowed'
 '   - if exterior & pitched & opaque = ROOF PITCHED'
 '   - if facing ground & horizontal = GROUND'
 '   - if facing another room & any orientation = PARTN'
 '  '
 '   Usages associated with child and grandchild surfaces'
 '   (e.g. not walls and roofs) :'
 '   - if exterior & horiz UP & transp = WINDOW SKYLIGHT'
 '   - if exterior & pitched & transp = WINDOW SKYLIGHT'
 '   - if exterior & vertical & transp = WINDOW'
 '   - if exterior & vertical & opaque = FRAME or DOOR'
 '   - if facing another room = FRAME or DOOR'
 '  '
 '3. Exterior surfaces should   | |                      '
 '   avoid extreme L shapes.    | |  obtuse interior     '
 '   Surfaces with lots of      | | /   angle here       '
 '   edges can cause problems.  | |/_____                '
 '   (e.g. ceiling of passage)  |________                '
 '  '
 '4. Only one child surface is allowed per parent, if more '
 '   child surfaces are required divide a parent into two '
 '   surfaces and make one child in each.'
 ' '
 'When generating the notional model all areas for parents'
 '& children that are not glazed are conserved. Additional'
 'glazing is added to all exterior surfaces as per UK NCM. '
 '* if parent surface is not wall/roof no glazing is added'
 '(This is exceptional and is discouraged)'
 'In order to calculate the required glazed area, gross  '
 'parent area is used (e.g. if a wall has a door in it then'
 'the glazed area is some % of (wall area + door area))'
 ' '
 'If glazing area in original is more than required for  '
 'notional then the same area is retained in notional model'
 ' '
 '5. If you have not attributed some use (eg door) to zone'
 '   surfaces then do so before defining a notional model.'
 ' '
 'For interior surfaces it is assumed that all vertical '
 'surfaces are walls. Horizontal interior surfaces are '
 'internal roofs/ceilings. '
