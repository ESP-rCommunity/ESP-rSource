*item EBCNTRL sys_bctl_multi_sensor
'A multi-sensor control is used to inject/extract heat in one zone'
'(termed source) based on conditions in other locations (termed'
'auxilliary sensors).'
' '
'If any of the auxilliary sensors demands heat then heat will be'
'injected in the source zone. For cooling heat will be extracted'
'from the source. If there are simultaneous demands for heating'
'and cooling nothing will happen.'
' '
'A classic use is to condition a mixing box/air handler used'
'within an air flow network to deliver heating or cooling to'
'an occupied space. '
' '
'If you are using a multi-sensor controller to enable a chilled'
'ceiling (represented as a zone) or a radiant heating panel'
'or a Korean Ondol thin floor heater (represented as a zone)'
'then these set  points are the temperature of the working fluid in'
'the radiant panel. Later you will be asked for the set points'
'for the occupied space(s). '
' '
'If you do not wish cooling use a high set point such as 100C'
'A 0 deg C cooling setpoint does not turn cooling off. '
' '
'Example: to heat a radiant panel to 70C in order to get a'
'temperature of 21C in adjacent room(s).'
' '
'Heat delivery may be less than the max. If minimium'
'heating > 0 then heating will continue at a reduced level'
'even when the setpoint is reached. If there is no cooling'
'then use zero values in conjunction with a high cooling setpoint.'
' '
'Note this type of control is an ON/OFF control and thus you'
'should use an appropriately short timestep of one or two minutes'
'if there is not much mass in the radiant panel or if there is a'
'considerable air air flow rate. '
' '
'Note: set the sensor at the air node rather than mixed rad/conv.'
' '
'Also for both heating and cooling panels it is common to inject'
'at the air node and to use a heat transfer coefficient regime '
'at the surfaces to ensure flux is transferred to the panel. '
'For a mixing box it is usually not necessary to use a hc regime.'
' '
'The aux sensor details are the usual 4 values:'
'  Example: to sense air temperature is 3rd zone'
'    3.0  0.0  0.0  0.0'
' '
'This data is followed - per sensor - by the heating set-point'
'and cooling set-point for that auxiliary sensor.'
' '
'Thus the number of control data items is thus 7 + 6 * no. of sensors'
' '
' Example: to sense air temperature in 3rd zone which'
'    needs to be heated to 21.1C and no cooling'
'    3.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 21.1 100.0 '

'checking the data/QA report afterwards.'

'The optimum start controller allows for three modes '
'of operation: '
' (1) Default start at 4AM'

'     A New Optimum Start Control Algorithm in Proceedings'
'     of International Symposium on Control and Operation'
'     of Building HVAC Systems in 1985 Trondheim, Norway'
' '
'Note this control is designed for optimum start of heating only.'
'It is one of the lesser used controls - pay attention to the'
'predicted performance.'
' '
'Heating capacity is in W to be used during the optimum startup'
'period. '
' '
'The heating setpoint (C) is the desired temperature at the'
'desired-time-of-arrival. '
' '
'The band of acceptable temperatures (C) is applied to the heating'
'setpoint to provide an upper and lower setpoints. A small band'
'will force tighter control.'
' '
'If the optimal control does not reach the band of acceptable'
'temperature at the desired-time-of-arrival then it will rewind'
'and try again. You can control the time difference between'
'successive trails by setting a minimum-time-difference. '
' '
'The Birtles & John Eqn. asks for three coefficients - the first'
'is a heating constant, the second is a building constant and the'
'third is an exterior temperature constant. Please review the paper'
'in order to understand these coefficients. '

'Proportional capacity slave controller. Typically a slave control'
'is used to represent an environmental control with a thermostat in'
'one zone and actions in other zones.'
'  '
' Example: a residentail AC system with a central fan delivering'
' to several zones.'
' '
'Flux is delivered to slave control when required by the master'
'control, at same % of base (max) capacity.'
' '
'You are asked for three values:'
'  - index of control loop associated with the master control'
'    (which MUST use a basic ideal controller or a free float'
'    control and the master MUST also sense a specific zone in'
'    the model).'
' '
'  - base (maximum) heating capacity for slave'
'  - base (maximum  cooling capacity for slave.'
' '
'Procedure - first create the master control loop and then create'
'a slave loop for each other zones in the model which are to act'
'as slaves. If the master control loop is for particular day types'
'e.g. weekday Saturday Sunday then each slave control should follow'
'this pattern and the number of periods should also match. '
' '
'The sensor of each slave controller MUST point to the SAME zone'
'that the master controller senses.'
' '
'The actuator of each slave controller MUST point to the slave zone.'
' '
'The simulation timestep should typically be short enough to reflect'
'the cycling of the environmental control system. '
' '
'Example: in a house there is 4kW of heating and the thermostat is'
'in the lounge which has 1kW of heating so the slave capacity in'
'the other zones should total to 3kW. Setting the capacity in each'
'slave zone can be done via different methods:'
' a) as a proportion of the duct flow or radiator size in each'
'    slave zone'
' b) by doing an initial simulation with each zone ideally controlled'
'    and noticing the ratio of the peak demands in each room'
' c) (roughly) as a function of zone volume or floor area.'

'reach the desired setpoint.'

'It is recommended that a short timestep be used with this control'

' '
'This control law can be used to check whether an air based system'
'is able to meet demand patterns in a room prior to specification'
'of a detailed component model. If flow rates or supply temperature'
'are not well sepecified then the room temperature will drift '
'as expected. '
' '
'Specification of minimum flow rate is a compromise between what is'
'required for CAV heating and excess cooling in low-load conditions.'
' '
'Typically the maximum flow rate would be equivalent to 12-20 ach'
'in the zone. Low max flow rates can result in failure to meet the'

' c) ESP-r is normally compiled for domains of limited grid'

'    density and those who do this should carefully check their'
'    models and predictions.'
' '
' d) it is recommended that you plan your cfd domains first and'

' '
'It includes descriptive information: title, version and synopsis'
'as well as one or more images. These can be edited directly.'
' '

'small power and DHW are reported. Each set has a scaling factor so'
'has a scaling factor so that, for example 2 office zones can be'
'scaled to represent 15 offices.'
' '
'One useful facility of an IPV is to allow annual performance to be'
'derived from an actual annual assessment or scaled from three'
'seasonal runs: winter/transition/summer, or five runs: 1st winter/'
'spring/summer/autumn/2nd winter. Each run has a start/stop date'
'time frequency and heating and cooling degree day ratios. Periods'
'can be setup based on a best-fit scan of climate data (see option 5).'

'climate season and the 1/3/5 simulations being run. '
' '
'Ratios: are typically ratios between the number of days (for'
'lighting (or heating/cooling degree days for heating and cooling)'
'of the assessment period and the season. For an annual simulation'
'the ratios are 1.00. A typical winter week performance might be'
'multiplied by 8.9 to represent the whole 1st winter season. This'
'can save lots of computation time and if properly calibrated for'
'the building type and location can also be quite accurate.'
' '
'Option 5 [re-scan climate] is a two step process; the first step'

'  This is the most commonly used fluid flow node.'
' '
'  Additional internal nodes can be used to implement controls'

'  These additional nodes are not associated with the thermal'
'  zone, but take their temperature from another flow node which'
'  is associated with a thermal zone. If you want to create such'
'  an additional bookkeepping node then say no to questions about'
'  zone linking and later you will be asked which flow node to take'
'  its temperature from. '
' '
'internal:known - another node describing a volume of air'
'  inside the building (usually a zone) the pressure is fixed'
'  and specified by the user (e.g. the outlet of a fan could be'
'  specified as an internal:known node.)  This type of node is'
'  infrequently used because we tend not to know the pressure'
'  or the pressure varies. You will be asked for the gauge'
'  pressure in  Pa.'
' '
'boundary:known - a node describing conditions at the '
'  boundary of the flow network. The pressure of this node'
'  (and sometimes temperature) is assigned by the user. An'
'  example might be to approximate a blower door test. Again'
'  this type of node is infrequently used. You will be asked'
'  for the gauge pressure in  Pa as well as a constant'
'  temperature at the node or a choice of ambient temperature.'
' '
'boundary:wind induced - another node describing the conditions'
'  at the boundary of the network. In this case the pressure of'
'  this node is generated by wind impinging upon a surface. The'
'  pressure is a function of wind velocity, wind direction and a'
'  pressure coefficient, Cp, (assigned based on the orientation'

*item prj topic_other_interface
'ESP-r can be compiled to present different styles of interface to'
'the user. The following is a general overview:'
'  '
' X11 - this is the legacy graphic interface originally used on'
'       engineering workstations. This interface is available on'
'       computers running Linux and OSX as well as the Cygwin'
'       emulation environment. It is full featured (click on the'
'       graphic window is active), but there is no file browser'
'       or pop-up proformas and the text feedback window does not'
'       support cut and paste operations. User interactions via the'
'       keyboard with menus are supported so the X11 interface can'
'       be driven via keystrokes as well as mouse movements.'
'  '
' GTK - this version of ESP-r uses the GTK graphic toolkit which'
'       has been ported to all operating systems that ESP-r can be'
'       compiled for - Linux, OSX, Cygwin and Native Windows. There'
'       is a file browser available as well as pop-up dialogs and'
'       re-sizable graphic and text feedback areas. The text feedback'
'       area supports cut and paste operations. The graphic display'
'       area is not mouse sensitive and the command menus do not'
'       notice keystrokes. '
'       On Linux and OSX and Cygwin the GTK version can act as a'
'       pure-text executable via the -mode text option. For the'
'       Native Windows version of ESP-r there is a separate set of'
'       pure-text executables (the -mode text option does not work'
'       with the Native Windows GTK executable).'
'  '
' pure text - this version of ESP-r does not rely on any graphic'
'       libraries or toolkits. It is purely driven by user keystrokes'
'       and is often used for production automation scripts as well'
'       as for low bandwidth remote access tasks. The command line'
'       options -mode text can be used for the X11 and GTK versions
'       of ESP-r on Linux, OSX and Cygwin. There is a separate Windows'
'       console application set of ESP-r modules.'
'  '
'A few graphic options are not available in the GTK version - clicking'
'on the wireframe image to select vertices is not supported. The click-'
'on-bitmap graphic zone input facility does not work. And the lack of'
'keystroke support for the command menus limits its use for automated'
'tasks.'
'  '
'Some pre-compiled versions of ESP-r provide both the X11 and GTK'
'versions via a bin_X11 and bin_GTK folders.'
*enditem
*item prj topic_other_OS'
'ESP-r can be used on computers with several different operating'
'systems. The features of each operating system can constrain or'
'enhance ESP-r features:'
'  '
' Unix/Linux - on laptops, desktops and compute servers Linux/Unix'
'    provides the highest level of security as well as extensive'
'    scripting facilities for production work. The fine resolution'
'    of file and folder permissons allows administrators to protect'
'    corporate databases and archived models.'
'    The many scripting languages and command shells allow for'
'    complex sequences of model adjustment and simulation tasks to'
'    be carried out. Multiple user access and remote access can be'
'    used by distributed work groups.'
'  '
' OSX - on laptops and desktops OSX is roughly equivalent to Linux'
'    in terms of security, scripting and remote access. As with Linux'
'    folder and file permissions can be set at a fine resolution to'
'    protect corporate databases. '
'  '
' Cygwin on Windows - Cygwin provides most of the scripting and'
'    command shell choices of Linux but without needing to dual boot'
'    the computer. Cygwin exists as a set of folders within the'
'    Windows file structure and Windows Explorer can see the ESP-r'
'    model files and folders and Windows tools can be used to edit'
'    and/or display model files and assessment reports.'
'    Note: do not run both the Native Windows version of ESP-r and'
'    a Cygwin version of ESP-r on the same computer - libraries'
'    used tend to get get confused and cause instability.'
'  '
' Native Windows version - compiled as a Windows graphic application'
'    or as a DOS console application. The scripting facilities and'
'    command shell options are constrained on Windows. It is very'
'    difficult to protect corporate databases and archive models from'
'    corruption by normal users. This version is ok for individual'
'    projects but tends not to meet the criteria set by many companies'
'    for robustness and security of use.'
'  '
'It is possible to convert models generate on one computer type to'
