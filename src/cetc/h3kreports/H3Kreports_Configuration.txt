    A flexible and extensible reporting facility for ESP-r 
    with support for xml output


ABSTRACT

This document describes the configuration and use of h3Kreports.


INTRODUCTION

H3Kreports is a C++ based reporting facility designed to compliment 
ESP-r's existing 'res' program.  During the simulation, routines in
ESP-r pass data to H3Kreports. Upon the completion of the simulation,
H3Kreports outputs the stored data in a variety of different formats.

REQUIREMENTS 

H3Kreports requires the libxml2 library. The libxslt library is not
required, but may facilitate formatting H3Kreports output.

COMPILATION 

ESP-r is not compiled with H3Kreports by default. To build H3Kreports,
CETC's makefile, "Makefile_dev" must be used, and the XMLstatus flag 
must be set to "ok". The following command will compile ESP-r with 
h3kreports and install it into the user's home directory(ie. '~/esp-r') 
if run from the 'esru/src' directory. 

   $ make -f Makefile_dev XMLstatus=ok

Other compile options are documented within Makefile_dev

CONFIGURATION

H3Kreports is configured using an xml file, called "input.xml".  
H3Kreports expects to find this file in a model's /cfg directory. If
the file is not found, a set of defaults are assumed. There is no
support for configuring H3Kreports through ESP-r's graphical
interfaces, and such capabilities are not envisioned in the future. 

The basic structure of input.xml is as follows:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <configuration>

      <option_1>value</option_1>

      <option_2>value</option_2>

      <option_3>value</option_3>

   </configuration>



The <?xml ?> and <configuration /> tags are required. The <option_X />
tags alter H3Kreports' default behavior, and are not required. Valid
configuration options include:
   
   <apply_style_sheet> 

     - Instructs H3Kreports to apply a set of  xslt transforms to out.xml
       using the style sheets specified with the <style_sheet> tag, in order. 
       The transform will only be applied if the specified style sheets can
       be found and are readable. The xslt output will be directed to 
       the file specified with the <transform_destination_file> tag.     

     - Valid values: true, false (default) 


   <dump_all_data>

     - Instructs H3Kreports to store and output all data, in both 
       .xml and .csv formats, regardless of which variable names 
       were requested. 

     - Valid values: true, false (default)


   <enable_xml_wildcards>

     - Enables simple wildcard matching when comparing x-path variable
       names with requested output. 

     - Valid values: true, false (default)


   <hierarchy>

     - Instructs H3Kreports to format xml output in flat, or nested
       "tree" format.

     - Valid values: flat, tree (default)

   <link_style_sheet> 

     - Instructs H3Kreports to include a link to the first specified style
       sheet with the <style_sheet> tag to the out.xml file. If specified, 
       the path included using the <style_sheet> tag will be used. 
       The other stylesheets included in the input file will not be included. 

     - Valid values: true, false (default)  

   <log_variable>

     - Instructs H3Kreports to calculate and store summary statistics
       (min, max, average, monthly bin) for the specified variable. 
       The specified variable will appear in out.xml.

     - Valid values: x-path name for any H3Kreports variable. If the 
       <enable_xml_wildcards> tag has been set to true, simple
       wildcard matching is also available.

           examples:

               plant/Fan_3/power/net_power

               plant/Fan_*/power/*        (wildcard matching, matches above)

               
   <output_dictionary> 
  
     - Instructs H3Kreports to output a list of all variables
       encountered during a simulation in ascii format. The list will
       appear in a file called "out.dictionary". This option is
       especially useful if you are unfamiliar with the H3Kreports
       variable naming convention used in ESP-r. 

     - Valid values: true, false (default)


   <report_startup_period_data>

     - Instructs H3Kreports to output data collected during the simulation
       start-up period, in addition to that collected during the normal
       simulation period.

     - Valid values: true, false (default)

     
   <step_variable>

     - Instructs H3Kreports to store time-step data for the specified
       variable. The specified variable will appear in out.csv, and
       its time step data will be included in out.xml.

     - Valid values: x-path name for any H3Kreports variable. If the 
       <enable_xml_wildcards> tag has been set to true, simple
       wildcard matching is also available.

           examples:

               plant/Fan_3/power/net_power

               plant/[a-zA-Z0-9/_]*  (wildcard matching, matches above)

     - Note: when wildcard matching is used to match a large set of
       variables, ESP-r's memory requirements and the file sizes of 
       out.xml & out.csv can grow significantly.

       
   <style_sheet>

     - Specifies a  xslt style sheet. There can be more than
       one stylesheet included. They will be performed in series. 
       This is useful for preprocessing the data for unit conversion and 
       maybe language translation. Note that the currently only XSLT 1.0 
       is supported using the "LIBXSLT" c tool. 

     - Valid value: path to any valid .xsl file.

     - Various xsl files can be found in CETC's repository in the
       xsl directory:
          
          bg_esp-r/src/cetc/h3kreports/xsl/
     
   <summary_variable>

     - Instructs H3Kreports to store and output summary statistics 
       for the specified variable. The specified variable will 
       appear in out.summary.

     - Valid values: x-path name for any H3Kreports variable. If the 
       <enable_xml_wildcards> tag has been set to true, simple
       wildcard matching is also available.

           examples:

               plant/Fan_3/power/net_power

               plant/Fan_*/power/*  (wildcard matching, matches above)

               
   <time_step_averaging>
 
     - Instructs H3Kreports to ignore ESP-r's time-step averaging
       setting. If the provided value is true, time-step averaging
       will be enabled, otherwise no time-step averaging will be
       performed. If this tag is omitted from input.xml, the time-step
       averaging setting  specified for the simulation will be used.  

     - Valid values: true, false 


   <transform_destination_file>

     - Instructs H3Kreports to save the output from an xslt transform 
       in the provided file. 

     - Valid value: path to any writable file.



ADDING DATA TO H3KREPORTS OUTPUT

A single function call is used to pass data to H3KReports:

   add_to_xml_reporting(
        (real) Latest calculated value,
        (string) Variable name
        (string) Metadata mame
        (string) Metadata value
        (string) Variable Description
   )

Arguements:

   -> Latest calculated value: real value of the variable to be
      included in H3KReports
   
   -> Variable name: Unique identifier for variable. Use of
      xpath notation to group variables is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
      Examples:

        'building/zone_1/casual_gains/radiant'
        'plant/Fuel_Cell/misc_data/electrical_efficiency'
        'climate/dry_bulb_temperature'

      More examples are available in out.dictionary.

   -> Metadata name: Type of metadata associated with variable.
      Typically 'units' is used.

   -> Metadata value: Metadata to be associated with variable.
      Common values include '(oC)', '(W)', '(kg/s)', '(-)'

   -> Variable description: Short, human-readable description
      of the variable. (These strings will one-day be appended
      to the variable names listed in out.dictionary.)


Example:

      call add_to_xml_reporting(
     &     Fuel_Cell_Heat_Recovery,
     &     'plant/Fuel_Cell/misc_data/heat_recovery',
     &     'units',
     &     '(W),
     &     'Rate of heat transfer from fuel cell to cooling water'
     & )
