ABSTRACT
================================

This document describes the configuration and use of h3Kreports.


INTRODUCTION
================================

H3Kreports is a C++ based reporting facility designed to compliment 
ESP-r's existing 'res' program.  During the simulation, routines in
ESP-r pass data to H3Kreports. Upon the completion of the simulation,
H3Kreports outputs the stored data in a variety of different formats.

REQUIREMENTS 
================================

H3Kreports requires the libxml2 library. The libxslt library is not
required, but may facilitate formatting H3Kreports output. SQLite 
is not require, but database output is only avaible when installed.

By design, H3Kreports stores simulation results on the heap, enabling 
swift recovery. However, bps's resulting memory requirements can 
approach or exceed the available system memory when:

  - annual simulations are performed at small timesteps, and/or

  - a large number of output data are requested.


COMPILATION 
================================

ESP-r is not compiled with H3Kreports by default. To build ESP-r 
with support for H3Kreports, the H3Kreports option must be selected
during the install procedure (or the '--xml' command line option 
must be provided).

CONFIGURATION
================================

H3Kreports is configured using an xml file, called "input.xml".  
H3Kreports expects to find this file in a model's /cfg directory. If
the file is not found, a set of defaults are assumed. There is only
limited support for configuring H3Kreports through ESP-r's graphical
interfaces. 

The basic structure of input.xml is as follows:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <configuration>

      <option_1>value</option_1>

      <option_2>value</option_2>

      <option_3>value</option_3>

   </configuration>



The <?xml ?> and <configuration /> tags are required. The <option_X />
tags alter H3Kreports' default behavior, and are not required. Valid
configuration options include:
   
   <apply_style_sheet> 

     - Instructs H3Kreports to apply a set of  xslt transforms to out.xml
       using the style sheets specified with the <style_sheet> tag, in order. 
       The transform will only be applied if the specified style sheets can
       be found and are readable. The xslt output will be directed to 
       the file specified with the <transform_destination_file> tag.     

     - Valid values: true, false (default) 


   <dump_all_data>

     - Instructs H3Kreports to store and output all data, in specified 
       formats, regardless of which variable names were requested. 
       
       NOTE: performing a complete dump of all simulation data requires
       significant amounts of system memory. When dumping results from 
       annual simulations run at short (that is, 1-5 minute timesteps),
       bps's may require several hundred megabytes, or even gigabytes 
       of memory. The <save_to_disk> option, discussed below, will 
       reduce these requirements.

     - Valid values: true, false (default)

   <step_output_format> 

     - Instructs H3Kreports to store the output of step data in the 
       specified format.  CSV output will be stored in a "out.csv"
       file.  Database output will be stored in a "out.db3" file. 

       NOTE: the db format produces an SQLite3 database file epr-r
       must be built with the --SQLite option for this format to be
       available.

     - Valid values: all, db, csv (default)

   <log_output_format> 

     - Instructs H3kreports to store the output of log data in the 
       specified format.  XML output will be stored in "out.xml".   
       Database output will be stored in "out.db3".

       NOTE: the db format produces an SQLite3 database file epr-r
       must be built with the --SQLite option for this format to be
       available.

     - Valid values: all, db, xml (default)

   <enable_xml_wildcards>

     - Enables simple wildcard matching when comparing x-path variable
       names with requested output.

     - Valid values: true, false (default)


   <hierarchy>

     - Instructs H3Kreports to format xml output in flat, or nested
       "tree" format.

     - Valid values: flat, tree (default)

   <link_style_sheet> 

     - Instructs H3Kreports to include a link to the first specified style
       sheet with the <style_sheet> tag to the out.xml file. If specified, 
       the path included using the <style_sheet> tag will be used. 
       The other stylesheets included in the input file will not be included. 

     - Valid values: true, false (default)  

   <log_variable>

     - Instructs H3Kreports to calculate and store summary statistics
       (min, max, average, monthly bin) for the specified variable. 
       The specified variable will appear in the output format defined
       in <log_output_format>.

     - Valid values: x-path name for any H3Kreports variable. If the 
       <enable_xml_wildcards> tag has been set to true, simple
       wildcard matching is also available.

           examples:

               plant/Fan_3/power/net_power

               plant/Fan_*/power/*        (wildcard matching, matches above)

               
   <output_dictionary> 

     - Instructs H3Kreports to output a list in ascii format of variables
       avaible for reporting.  This list will appear in a file called 
       "out.dictionary".  There are two options for dictionary output. 
       Option "sim": reports simulation encountered variable names (fully 
           defined). 
       Option "all": reports all the defined variables available for 
           reporting in esp-r before their name are resoved.  Expect
           the apperance of wilcards * in the variable names.  These
           are to be replaced by character sets during the simulation run. 

     - Valid values: sim(default), all, off 
		     true, false (legacy support - true .eq. sim)

   <report_startup_period_data>

     - Instructs H3Kreports to output data collected during the simulation
       start-up period, in addition to that collected during the normal
       simulation period.

     - Valid values: true, false (default)

   <save_to_disk every="#rows">
     - Instructs H3Kreports to push the step data to defined output 
       every #rows.  This option will significantly reduce bps's 
       memory requirements on longer simulation, but is only effective
       if options <dump_all_data>true</dump_all_data> or
       <step_variable>...</step_variable> are set.  The optional "every" 
       attribute instructs H3Kreports how many timestep before a write to
       is done.        

     - Valid values: true, false
     - Attribute "every"(optional): 100-10000 default 1000 if unspecified
     
   <step_variable>

     - Instructs H3Kreports to store time-step data for the specified
       variable. The specified variable will appear the output format
       specified with the <log_output_format> option.  

     - Valid values: x-path name for any H3Kreports variable. If the 
       <enable_xml_wildcards> tag has been set to true, simple
       wildcard matching is also available.

           examples:

               plant/Fan_3/power/net_power

               plant/[a-zA-Z0-9/_]*  (wildcard matching, matches above)

     - Note: when wildcard matching is used to match a large set of
       variables, ESP-r's memory requirements and the file sizes of 
       out.csv can grow significantly.
       
   <style_sheet>

     - Specifies a  xslt style sheet. There can be more than
       one stylesheet included. They will be performed in series. 
       This is useful for preprocessing the data for unit conversion and 
       maybe language translation. Note that the currently only XSLT 1.0 
       is supported using the "LIBXSLT" c tool. 

     - Valid value: path to any valid .xsl file.

     - Various xsl files can be found in CETC's repository in the
       xsl directory:
          
          bg_esp-r/src/cetc/h3kreports/xsl/
     
   <summary_variable>

     - Instructs H3Kreports to store and output summary statistics 
       for the specified variable. The specified variable will 
       appear in out.summary.

     - Valid values: x-path name for any H3Kreports variable. If the 
       <enable_xml_wildcards> tag has been set to true, simple
       wildcard matching is also available.

           examples:

               plant/Fan_3/power/net_power

               plant/Fan_*/power/*  (wildcard matching, matches above)

               
   <time_step_averaging>
 
     - Instructs H3Kreports to ignore ESP-r's time-step averaging
       setting. If the provided value is true, time-step averaging
       will be enabled, otherwise no time-step averaging will be
       performed. If this tag is omitted from input.xml, the time-step
       averaging setting  specified for the simulation will be used.  

     - Valid values: true, false 


   <transform_destination_file>

     - Instructs H3Kreports to save the output from an xslt transform 
       in the provided file. 

     - Valid value: path to any writable file.



ADDING DATA TO H3KREPORTS OUTPUT
================================

Step 1: Define the variable





A single function call is used to pass data to H3KReports:

   add_to_xml_reporting(
        (real) Latest calculated value,
        (string) Variable name
        (string) Metadata mame
        (string) Metadata value
        (string) Variable Description
   )

Arguements:

   -> Latest calculated value: real value of the variable to be
      included in H3KReports
   
   -> Variable name: Unique identifier for variable. Use of
      xpath notation to group variables is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
      Examples:

        'building/zone_1/casual_gains/radiant'
        'plant/Fuel_Cell/misc_data/electrical_efficiency'
        'climate/dry_bulb_temperature'

      More examples are available in out.dictionary.

   -> Metadata name: Type of metadata associated with variable.
      Typically 'units' is used.

   -> Metadata value: Metadata to be associated with variable.
      Common values include '(oC)', '(W)', '(kg/s)', '(-)'

   -> Variable description: Short, human-readable description
      of the variable. (These strings will one-day be appended
      to the variable names listed in out.dictionary.)


Example:

      call add_to_xml_reporting(
     &     Fuel_Cell_Heat_Recovery,
     &     'plant/Fuel_Cell/misc_data/heat_recovery',
     &     'units',
     &     '(W),
     &     'Rate of heat transfer from fuel cell to cooling water'
     & )
     
     
   
      
H3Kreports MEMORY FOOTPRINT 
===========================

By design, H3Kreports saves simulation results in memory. Most of 
these data are stored on the heap, in vectors that grow dynamically 
as new data are calculated.  As a result, bps's memory footprint 
can grow as the simulation progresses.

When conducting long simulations at small timesteps, bps's memory 
requirements can approach or exceed the available memory on the system.
The following guidelines can help ensure bps's requirements do not 
exceed system resources in these circumstances:
  
  - the <dump_all_data> facility should be used with extreme caution.
  - only a limited number of <log_variable> tags should be used.
  - the <save_to_disk> should be used to page timestep data to disk 
    rather than storing it on the heap.
