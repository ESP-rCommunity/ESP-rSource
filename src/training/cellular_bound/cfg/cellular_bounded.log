Notes:
 
This is a variant of cellular_bc.cfg which implements
a ceiling void above the occupied space, a ceiling
void below the occupied space structure and an upper
boundary zone representing the floor above.

Often simulation projects focus on one level of a building.
And the boundary conditions are not necessarily exactly
the same as the occupied space. Where there are raised
floors and/or suspended ceilings their temperatures may
be substantially different. This model demonstrates how
low resolution bounding zones and specific controls
can be used to improve the assessments of focus levels.

The lower ceiling void is controlled to be at the same
temperature as the upper ceiling void so as to act as
a lower boundary to the occupied space.

The upper boundary zone is controlled to be at the
same temperature as the average of the two manager
rooms so as to act as an upper boundary condition.

This model highlights the use of zone control law 11
which implements temperature matching.
