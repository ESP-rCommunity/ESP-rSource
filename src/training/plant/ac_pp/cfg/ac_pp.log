This is a heating and ventilating system which
makes use of plant components based on primitive
parts.

The configuration file is ac_PP.cfg
The control file is ac_pp.ctl
The plant network description is ac_pp.pnf

The building portion of the problem is the
standard three zone exemplar.

You may look at a standard building & plant
libraries in ac_PP.res and ac_PP.plr
which are for a one day simulation on
11 of February.  They use the standard climate
database.  INteresting phychrometric data 
can be plotted around mid-day which is
at timestep 360.

Recommended building timesteps should be
6 timesteps per hour.

Recommended plant timesteps should be equivalent
to 2 minute intervals (or less).
