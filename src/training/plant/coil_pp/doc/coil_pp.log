This is a primitive parts representation of a
4 row counterflow cooling coil.

The configuration file is: coil.bps

The plant network is defined in coil.pnf

It uses the standard (corporate) plant components
database (plantc.db1)

There is no control file at this time - the
problem works as a steady-state solution
of the plant network.  It is possible to
simulate a dynamic system by the addition
of a control file for instance:
  The incomming water temperature could be step changed
  from 6 degC to 10 degC.

The running conditions are:
a) Incomming air flow rate is constant at 2.384 m3/sec
b) Incomming air temperature is 30 degC
c) Incomming water flow rate is 0.0009002 m3/seC
d) Incomming water temperature is 6 degC

The best timestep to use is 36000 per hour
which is equivalent to 0.1 second

The absolute error (in the simulation toggles menu
of the simulator) should be set to < 0.01 degC if
you wish to have a smooth output (but at the
expense of a long computation).  If somewhat
less accuracy is required then this can be 
set to the default value.

The relative error should be set to < 1%.
