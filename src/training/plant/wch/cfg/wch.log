This problem is an investigation of the influence of acceleration
heating on the behaviour of a mechanical room thermostat.

The model involves a single zone building which is serviced by
a wet central heating system consisting of a boiler, a radiator,
a pump, and some piping. The control of the system is with a
mechanical room thermostat.

This is the problem as described in Section 7.4.3. of Hensen's
doctoral dissertation "On the thermal interaction of building
structure and heating and ventilating system", Eindhoven
University of Technology, 1991.



          7.4.3.  Influence of  Acceleration  Heating  on  Room  Thermostat
          Behaviour

          This final case study was inspired by experimental findings  from
          the  pilot  measurements which were mentioned in Chapter 1. These
          measurements, reported in (Hensen et al. 1987), were carried  out
          in a relatively small flat with ditto heating system (wet central
          heating system, controlled  by  a  mechanical  room  thermostat).
          Technical considerations led to some modifications of the heating
          system during the measurements, one of which  was  disabling  the
          thermostat's  acceleration  heating  (which  is used to raise the
          temperature of the sensor more  rapidly  towards  the  switch-off
          temperature  in  order  to decrease the room air temperature dif-
          ferential). The  acceleration  heating  is  very  important  with
          respect to the boiler switch frequency. In this specific case and
          given the prevailing environmental conditions, the  burner  cycle
          time  (burner-on  till  burner-on) was about 90 times longer when
          the acceleration heating was disabled. The total burner-on time -
          for an equal period of time - was approximately 50% shorter, sug-
          gesting a strong decrease in fuel consumption. It should be noted
          however, that in this specific case both the number of cycles per
          hour (at average heating season conditions ~ 30) and  the  boiler
          stand-by heat losses may be regarded as well above average.
          A longer cycle time also has consequences  with  respect  to  the
          fluctuation of the air temperature. Without the acceleration ele-
          ment the fluctuation of the mean room air temperature during  one
          cycle, is much larger. Thermal comfort acceptability criteria for
          these fluctuating conditions, were discussed in Chapter 2.

               plant  configuration  comprising a living room serviced
               by (part of) a wet central heating system.


          The objective of the present case study is  to  see  whether  the
          above  mentioned observations can be repeated - by computer simu-
          lation - for a more general  case,  and  to  investigate  whether
          decrease  of thermostat acceleration heating might be a potential
          energy conservation strategy.  Due to  available  resources,  the
          following is a very limited attempt in this respect, but is to be
          felt useful in demonstrating yet another field of application  of
          the models described in this dissertation.

          Imagine a building and plant configuration as schematically shown
          in  Figure  7.12. The room is facing due south, and is located at
          ground level of a reference house for energy related research  as
          described  in  (NOVEM  1990),  which  represents a typical Dutch,
          garden-orientated, terraced house. The exterior envelope is insu-
          lated  according to prevailing regulations (walls and roof: ther-
                                   2                                 2

          For the present study, the air temperatures of the spaces adjoin-
          ing the living room are kept at constant values as  indicated  in
          Figure 7.12. The infiltration rate (1.0 air changes per hour) was
          also kept constant, and for the casual gains a reference  profile
          as  suggested by Van der Laan et al. (1988) was used.  The living
          room is serviced by (part  of)  a  wet  central  heating  system,
          comprising:
          - a (two node model) radiator (M = 25 kg; c = 600 J/kgK)  with  a
            nominal  heat  emission  of  2000  W  (at  nominal temperatures
            90/70/20),  and  heat  emission  exponent  1.3.  The   radiator
            environment  temperature  is  evaluated (using equation (5.37))
            from the living room air temperature  and  the  inside  surface
            temperatures  of  the  facade and the ground floor.  The latter
            two are both assigned a weight factor (see equation (5.37))  of
            0.5.
          - the (two node model) boiler (M = 25 kg; c = 1000 J/kgK) denoted
            A2  in  Figure  5.12a, and with respect to stand-by losses, the
            boiler denoted C in Figure  5.12b.  The  normalized  start-stop
            losses  are  set  at 1 s, and upper boiler temperature limit is
                     o
            set at 95 C.  The gas consumption in stand-by mode is set at 1%
            of  the full load gas consumption. The latter is scaled down to
                                                                    3

          - a  mechanical  room  thermostat  (M = 0.05 kg;  c = 1000 J/kgK)
            located  in  the living room, and sensing a mix of air tempera-
            ture and inside surface temperature of the common dividing wall
            with  the neighbouring house and the wall separating the living
            from the hall.  The  equivalent  thermal  conductances  between
            these  temperatures  and  the  sensor  were estimated at: 0.04,
            0.01, and 0.01 W/K respectively.

          With respect to building/plant interaction and control, the  fol-
          lowing was defined:
          - a building side control function (as described in Section 5.6),
            defining  that  the heat output of the radiator would be effec-
            tuated at the building zone air point. Note that for all  other
                                                                     o
            plant components a constant containment temperature of 18 C was
            assumed
          - a first plant control loop to actuate the boiler on  the  basis
            of the temperature sensed by the room thermostat. Unless stated
                                                          o
            otherwise, the set point temperature was  21.5 C,  and  a  hys-
            teresis of 0.5 K was assumed.
          - a second plant control loop  sensing  whether  the  boiler  was
            actually  on  or off during a certain simulation time step, and
            which - in case it was on - inputs a heat flux into the sensing
            element.  This  control  loop  thus  simulates the acceleration
            heating of the room thermostat.




               Figure 7.13 Influence of acceleration heating on  fluc-
               tuation of mean living room air temperature and on tem-
               perature as sensed by the room thermostat during a  two
               hour simulation period.


          The degree of heat input is the  primary  parameter  to  be  con-
          sidered  in  the  following.  To  illustrate the influence of the
          degree of acceleration heating, Figure 7.13 shows some simulation
          results  comprising  a two hour period of a Dutch climatic refer-
          ence year for energy research (Bruggen  1978).   The  simulations
          were  performed for two values of thermostat heat input: 0.05 and
          0.10 W. For the given conditions, this gives either approximately
          1  or  2  cycles per hour, resulting in air temperature differen-
          tials of approximately 1 and 2 K respectively. Figure  7.13  also
          indicates  the set point differential. It may be seen that in the
          0.05 W input case, the sensed temperature still rises even  after
          the burner is switched off. This is due to the fact that at those
          points in time the room air temperature is actually  higher  than
          the  thermostat set point. Note that there are two transient fac-
          tors which play a role in the time lag and damping of the  sensed
          temperature  when  compared  to the room air temperature: (1) the
          sensed temperature depends on both air temperature  and  building
          construction  temperatures  (which  lag behind because of thermal
          inertia of the  building  materials),  and  (2)  thermal  inertia
          effects of the heating system itself.



               Figure  7.14 Influence of thermal load on sustained de-
               viation between room  air  temperature  and  set  point
                    o
               (21.5 C)  of  mechanical  room thermostat. Note the en-
               larged top y-axis scaling!


          As also demonstrated by Figure 7.13, the resulting  average  room
          air  temperature  is  affected  too by the degree of acceleration
          heating; ie the average air temperature increases with decreasing
          acceleration  heating.  There is however yet another factor which
          influences the resulting average room air temperature: the  ther-
          mal  load  of  the  system  (which affects the length of time the
          thermostat is switched on). This is clearly demonstrated by  Fig-
          ure  7.14 which shows the room air temperature (and its deviation
          from the thermostat set point) in relation to  the  ambient  tem-
          perature  which  is  obviously  a  measure  for  the thermal load
          imposed on the heating system.  When compared to average climatic
          conditions for The Netherlands, the data for January 13 represent
          an extremely cold day, while the data for January 15 represent  a
          fairly average day.
          For the simulations presented in Figure 7.14, a heat input to the
          thermostat  sensing element of 0.20 W was assumed, which resulted
          in burner cycle frequencies of approximately 3, 4, and 5 per hour
          for  the  periods around 1:00 and 12:00 on January 13, and around
          12:00 on January 15 respectively. This illustrates that the cycle
          frequency   decreases   when  the  thermal  load  increases.  The
          corresponding relative burner-on periods were approximately  73%,
          62%, and 32% respectively.


               Table  7.6  Results  of  simulations  -  comprising the
               period January 12 to January 15 inclusive - for various
               degrees of acceleration heating applied to the mechani-
               cal room thermostat
          

          To investigate  whether  the  overall  gas  consumption  is  also
          affected,  several simulations - comprising the period January 12
          to January 15 inclusive - were performed for various  degrees  of
          acceleration heating.  From the results presented above it may be
          clear that when the  simulations  would  start  from  a  constant
          thermostat set point, this would lead to different  average  room
          air  temperatures.  Obviously the results would then be incompar-
          able. Therefore some of the thermostat set  points  where  chosen
          (by  trial  and  error)  such that the resulting average room air
          temperature (for January 15) would be equal. The  most  important
          simulation  results  - with respect to the investigated problem -
          are collected in Table 7.6.

          When the cycle frequencies and the corresponding air  temperature
          differentials  are  compared with the thermal comfort criteria as
          described in Chapter 2, all cases presented  in  Table  7.6  fall
          within  the  comfort  limits  for  transient conditions. Only the
          cases with the smallest degree of heating acceleration seem to be
          critical  during  the  extremly cold day; ie air temperature dif-
          ferential (= peak-to-peak  amplitude)  approximately  3.3  K.  It
          should be noted however that the criteria as described in Chapter
          2 should be applied to the operative temperature, the fluctuation
          of  which  is  much smaller than the air temperature fluctuation.
          This is evidenced by Figure 7.15 which shows  simulation  results
                                           o
          for  the  "0.01 W and O    = 21.5 C" case during January 15. From
                                 set
          this figure it may also be concluded  that  in  order  to  create
          thermally  comfortable conditions, the thermostat set point would
                                     o
          have to be higher than 21.5 C, because the operative  temperature
          falls  below  the thermal comfort zone if we assume normal indoor
          clothing and nearly sedentary activity.



               Figure 7.15 Air, mean radiant, and  operative  tempera-
               ture  during  January  15  of  the  reference year, for
               U   = 0.01 W and O    = 21.5 C
                th               set


          When comparing the gas consumption results  for  the  cases  with
          equal average air temperature, Table 7.6 indeed evidences that it
          is possible to conserve energy - while maintaining thermally com-
          fortable  conditions  - by decreasing the burner cycle frequency.
                                                        -1
          Lowering the cycle frequency from 4.5 to 2.0 h  ,  results  in  a
          gas  consumption  reduction  of  only 1% when the whole period is
          taken into account, but in a 7% reduction when just the  "average
          heating  season  day" (ie January 15) is taken into account. This
          suggests that the optimal strategy is to apply  the  "cycle  fre-
          quency control" strategy selectively; ie weather dependent.

          Obviously the above has to be investigated further  with  respect
          to  what  is  the  optimal  strategy (ie development of rules for
          intelligent controllers), and for which type  of  systems  is  it
          applicable.  In  the  present  context, this case study should be
          regarded as a demonstration of applying the models  presented  in
          this thesis.
