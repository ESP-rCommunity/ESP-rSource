This problem is an investigation of the influence of acceleration
heating on the behaviour of a mechanical room thermostat.

The model involves a single zone building which is serviced by
a wet central heating system consisting of a boiler, a radiator,
a pump, and some piping. The control of the system is with a
mechanical room thermostat.

This is the problem as described in Section 7.4.3. of Hensen's
doctoral dissertation "On the thermal interaction of building
structure and heating and ventilating system", Eindhoven
University of Technology, 1991.



7.4.3.  Influence of  Acceleration  Heating  on  Room  Thermostat
        Behaviour

This final case study was inspired by experimental findings  from
the  pilot  measurements which were mentioned in Chapter 1. These
measurements, reported in (Hensen et al. 1987), were carried  out
in a relatively small flat with ditto heating system (wet central
heating system, controlled  by  a  mechanical  room  thermostat).
Technical considerations led to some modifications of the heating
system during the measurements, one of which  was  disabling  the
thermostat's  acceleration  heating  (which  is used to raise the
temperature of the sensor more  rapidly  towards  the  switch-off
temperature  in  order  to decrease the room air temperature dif-
ferential). The  acceleration  heating  is  very  important  with
respect to the boiler switch frequency. In this specific case and
given the prevailing environmental conditions, the  burner  cycle
time  (burner-on  till  burner-on) was about 90 times longer when
the acceleration heating was disabled. The total burner-on time -
for an equal period of time - was approximately 50% shorter, sug-
gesting a strong decrease in fuel consumption. It should be noted
however, that in this specific case both the number of cycles per
hour (at average heating season conditions ~ 30) and  the  boiler
stand-by heat losses may be regarded as well above average.

A longer cycle time also has consequences  with  respect  to  the
fluctuation of the air temperature. Without the acceleration ele-
ment the fluctuation of the mean room air temperature during  one
cycle, is much larger. Thermal comfort acceptability criteria for
these fluctuating conditions, were discussed in Chapter 2.

               plant  configuration  comprising a living room serviced
               by (part of) a wet central heating system.


The objective of the present case study is  to  see  whether  the
above  mentioned observations can be repeated - by computer simu-
lation - for a more general  case,  and  to  investigate  whether
decrease  of thermostat acceleration heating might be a potential
energy conservation strategy.  Due to  available  resources,  the
following is a very limited attempt in this respect, but is to be
felt useful in demonstrating yet another field of application  of
the models described in this dissertation.

Imagine a building and plant configuration as schematically shown
in  Figure  7.12. The room is facing due south, and is located at
ground level of a reference house for energy related research  as
described  in  (NOVEM  1990),  which  represents a typical Dutch,
garden-orientated, terraced house. The exterior envelope is insu-
lated  according to prevailing regulations (walls and roof: ther-
			 2				   2
mal resistance R  ~ 2.5 m K/W;  ground  floor:   R  ~ 1.3 m K/W).
		c ~				  c ~
For the present study, the air temperatures of the spaces adjoin-
ing the living room are kept at constant values as  indicated  in
Figure 7.12. The infiltration rate (1.0 air changes per hour) was
also kept constant, and for the casual gains a reference  profile
as  suggested by Van der Laan et al. (1988) was used.  The living
room is serviced by (part  of)  a  wet  central  heating  system,
comprising:
- a (two node model) radiator (M = 25 kg; c = 600 J/kgK)  with  a
  nominal  heat  emission  of  2000  W  (at  nominal temperatures
  90/70/20),  and  heat  emission  exponent  1.3.  The   radiator
  environment  temperature  is  evaluated (using equation (5.37))
  from the living room air temperature  and  the  inside  surface
  temperatures  of  the  facade and the ground floor.  The latter
  two are both assigned a weight factor (see equation (5.37))  of
  0.5.
- the (two node model) boiler (M = 25 kg; c = 1000 J/kgK) denoted
  A2  in  Figure  5.12a, and with respect to stand-by losses, the
  boiler denoted C in Figure  5.12b.  The  normalized  start-stop
  losses  are  set  at 1 s, and upper boiler temperature limit is
	   o
  set at 95 C.  The gas consumption in stand-by mode is set at 1%
  of  the full load gas consumption. The latter is scaled down to

  with  a  caloric heating value of 35 MJ/m , which yields a heat

- a pump delivering a fixed water flow rate of 2.4E-5 m /s
- two connecting lengths (10 m each) of 15  mm  in  diameter  wet
  central heating pipe
- a  mechanical  room  thermostat  (M = 0.05 kg;  c = 1000 J/kgK)
  located  in  the living room, and sensing a mix of air tempera-
  ture and inside surface temperature of the common dividing wall
  with  the neighbouring house and the wall separating the living
  from the hall.  The  equivalent  thermal  conductances  between
  these  temperatures  and  the  sensor  were estimated at: 0.04,
  0.01, and 0.01 W/K respectively.

With respect to building/plant interaction and control, the  fol-
lowing was defined:
- a building side control function (as described in Section 5.6),
  defining  that  the heat output of the radiator would be effec-
  tuated at the building zone air point. Note that for all  other
							   o
  plant components a constant containment temperature of 18 C was
  assumed
- a first plant control loop to actuate the boiler on  the  basis
  of the temperature sensed by the room thermostat. Unless stated
						o
  otherwise, the set point temperature was  21.5 C,  and  a  hys-
  teresis of 0.5 K was assumed.
- a second plant control loop  sensing  whether  the  boiler  was
  actually  on  or off during a certain simulation time step, and
  which - in case it was on - inputs a heat flux into the sensing
  element.  This  control  loop  thus  simulates the acceleration
  heating of the room thermostat.




     Figure 7.13 Influence of acceleration heating on  fluc-
     tuation of mean living room air temperature and on tem-
     perature as sensed by the room thermostat during a  two
     hour simulation period.


The degree of heat input is the  primary  parameter  to  be  con-
sidered  in  the  following.  To  illustrate the influence of the
degree of acceleration heating, Figure 7.13 shows some simulation
results  comprising  a two hour period of a Dutch climatic refer-
ence year for energy research (Bruggen  1978).   The  simulations
were  performed for two values of thermostat heat input: 0.05 and
0.10 W. For the given conditions, this gives either approximately
1  or  2  cycles per hour, resulting in air temperature differen-
tials of approximately 1 and 2 K respectively. Figure  7.13  also
indicates  the set point differential. It may be seen that in the
0.05 W input case, the sensed temperature still rises even  after
the burner is switched off. This is due to the fact that at those
points in time the room air temperature is actually  higher  than
the  thermostat set point. Note that there are two transient fac-
tors which play a role in the time lag and damping of the  sensed
temperature  when  compared  to the room air temperature: (1) the
sensed temperature depends on both air temperature  and  building
construction  temperatures  (which  lag behind because of thermal
inertia of the  building  materials),  and  (2)  thermal  inertia
effects of the heating system itself.



     Figure  7.14 Influence of thermal load on sustained de-
     viation between room  air  temperature  and  set  point
	  o
     (21.5 C)  of  mechanical  room thermostat. Note the en-
     larged top y-axis scaling!


As also demonstrated by Figure 7.13, the resulting  average  room
air  temperature  is  affected  too by the degree of acceleration
heating; ie the average air temperature increases with decreasing
acceleration  heating.  There is however yet another factor which
influences the resulting average room air temperature: the  ther-
mal  load  of  the  system  (which affects the length of time the
thermostat is switched on). This is clearly demonstrated by  Fig-
ure  7.14 which shows the room air temperature (and its deviation
from the thermostat set point) in relation to  the  ambient  tem-
perature  which  is  obviously  a  measure  for  the thermal load
imposed on the heating system.  When compared to average climatic
conditions for The Netherlands, the data for January 13 represent
an extremely cold day, while the data for January 15 represent  a
fairly average day.
For the simulations presented in Figure 7.14, a heat input to the
thermostat  sensing element of 0.20 W was assumed, which resulted
in burner cycle frequencies of approximately 3, 4, and 5 per hour
for  the  periods around 1:00 and 12:00 on January 13, and around
12:00 on January 15 respectively. This illustrates that the cycle
frequency   decreases	when  the  thermal  load  increases.  The
corresponding relative burner-on periods were approximately  73%,
62%, and 32% respectively.


     Table  7.6  Results  of  simulations  -  comprising the
     period January 12 to January 15 inclusive - for various
     degrees of acceleration heating applied to the mechani-
     cal room thermostat


To investigate  whether  the  overall  gas  consumption  is  also
affected,  several simulations - comprising the period January 12
to January 15 inclusive - were performed for various  degrees  of
acceleration heating.  From the results presented above it may be
clear that when the  simulations  would  start  from  a  constant
thermostat set point, this would lead to different  average  room
air  temperatures.  Obviously the results would then be incompar-
able. Therefore some of the thermostat set  points  where  chosen
(by  trial  and  error)  such that the resulting average room air
temperature (for January 15) would be equal. The  most  important
simulation  results  - with respect to the investigated problem -
are collected in Table 7.6.

When the cycle frequencies and the corresponding air  temperature
differentials  are  compared with the thermal comfort criteria as
described in Chapter 2, all cases presented  in  Table  7.6  fall
within  the  comfort  limits  for  transient conditions. Only the
cases with the smallest degree of heating acceleration seem to be
critical  during  the  extremly cold day; ie air temperature dif-
ferential (= peak-to-peak  amplitude)  approximately  3.3  K.  It
should be noted however that the criteria as described in Chapter
2 should be applied to the operative temperature, the fluctuation
of  which  is  much smaller than the air temperature fluctuation.
This is evidenced by Figure 7.15 which shows  simulation  results
				 o
for  the  "0.01 W and O    = 21.5 C" case during January 15. From
		       set
this figure it may also be concluded  that  in  order  to  create
thermally  comfortable conditions, the thermostat set point would
			   o
have to be higher than 21.5 C, because the operative  temperature
falls  below  the thermal comfort zone if we assume normal indoor
clothing and nearly sedentary activity.



               Figure 7.15 Air, mean radiant, and  operative  tempera-
               ture  during  January  15  of  the  reference year, for
               U   = 0.01 W and O    = 21.5 C
                th               set


 When comparing the gas consumption results  for  the  cases  with
 equal average air temperature, Table 7.6 indeed evidences that it
 is possible to conserve energy - while maintaining thermally com-
 fortable  conditions  - by decreasing the burner cycle frequency.
					       -1
 Lowering the cycle frequency from 4.5 to 2.0 h  ,  results  in  a
 gas  consumption  reduction  of  only 1% when the whole period is
 taken into account, but in a 7% reduction when just the  "average
 heating  season  day" (ie January 15) is taken into account. This
 suggests that the optimal strategy is to apply  the  "cycle  fre-
 quency control" strategy selectively; ie weather dependent.

 Obviously the above has to be investigated further  with  respect
 to  what  is  the  optimal  strategy (ie development of rules for
 intelligent controllers), and for which type  of  systems  is  it
 applicable.  In  the  present  context, this case study should be
 regarded as a demonstration of applying the models  presented  in
 this thesis.
