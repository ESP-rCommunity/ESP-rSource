This directory contains an exemplar control file 
in which non-ideal sensor and actuator characteristics 
are specified (i.e 4th sensor/actuator data itam = -1). 
At the present time, such files are generated using a text editor.

The control file has 4 plant control loops, 2 of which 
(loops 1 and 3) have non-ideal sensor and actuator 
characteristics imposed. Loop 3 contains a 
description of each data entry.

Points to note: 
              1/ The first data entry of each line indicates whether
                 characteristic is imposed (1) or not (-1). This 
                 facilitates parametric and sensitivity studies of 
                 the various non-ideal characteristics.
              2/ For economy of memory space, there is limit of 
                 2 control loops which may have non-ideal 
                 sensor/actuator and  characteristics imposed. This 
                 may be altered by amending the "control.h" include 
                 file.
