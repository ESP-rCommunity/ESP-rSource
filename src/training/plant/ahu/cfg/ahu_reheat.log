                 Multi zone air-conditioning system with reheat

               One extension to the basic A/C system is to divide  the
          supply  fan  outlet into the appropriate number of ducts and
          fitting a separate reheater to each. The output of the  cen-
          tral  plant cooling coil must be arranged to meet the demand
          of whichever zone requires the  maximum  cooling.  For  this
          reason a substantial amount of reheat will be required lead-
          ing to uneconomic running costs. In order to  simulate  this
          system, the reheat sections of the plant were coupled to the
          reception and office zones of the 3 zone building.

               A control loop was defined for each  reheater  so  that
          the  heating coil flux could be actuated on the basis of the
          appropriate zone air temperature. The fan air temperature is
          sensed  in  order  to actuate the flux for the central plant
          heating and cooling coils to control that temperature within
          cooling and heating set points of 23C and 20C respectively.

               A winter simulation was carried out  for  the  combined
          building/plant  model.  Although it is possible to include a
          fluid flow network in the simulation, it was not  considered
          for this example but was included in a multi-zone air condi-
          tioning system with VAV terminals in one of  the  exemplars.
          The  simulation  period  considered  was for the 9th January
          using ESP-r test climate file. The simulation was  conducted
          for a building time-step of 10 minutes and a plant time-step
          of 2 minutes and the following user input was specified  for
          ESP-r simulator:

               It can be concluded from the results  that  the  reheat
          system  is  capable  of  responding  to load requirements of
          individual zones when the correct heating and cooling energy
          for   the  central  plant  is  sufficient  to  maintain  the
          reheaters supply air at a desired level.
