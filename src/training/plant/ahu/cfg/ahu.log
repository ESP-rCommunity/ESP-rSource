	    Single zone air-conditioning system

     This system is suitable for air-conditioning large sin-
gle  spaces, such as theatres, cinemas, restaurants, exhibi-
tion halls or factory spaces where no  spatial  sub-division
exists.

     The heating coil is usually fed by  hot  water  from  a
boiler  whereas  the  coiling  coil  could  be either fed by
chilled water or could be directly connected to a refrigera-
tion  plant  and  so contain the actual refrigerant; this is
known as a direct expansion (DX) system. For  humidity  con-
trol,  this  system  can also be fitted with a humidifier so
that the relative humidity of the space supply  air  can  be
controlled if necessary.

     The reception zone of the test building was coupled  to
the air-conditioning system and a fluid flow network defined
for the combined plant/building problem.

     With the fluid flow network incorporated in the simula-
tion,  it is possible to include the air filter by introduc-
ing an additional flow resistance in the fluid flow  network
definition  file.   A  mechanical thermostat component (type
510) was used as a sensor to sense the zone  temperature  so
that the time lags associated with the sensor are taken into
account.

     The thermostat component was installed  on  the  inside
surface  of  the south facing wall of the reception room and
two sensors were attached to it, one is used to actuate  the
heating  coil flux and the other to actuate the cooling coil
flux. The cooling set point was chosen  to  be  23C  with  a
throttling  range  of  1C  while  the  heating set point was
chosen to be 20C with a throttling range  of  1C.  An  addi-
tional  sensor was defined to sense the relative humidity of
the air in the fan and a controller (plant  control  law  2)
was  defined  to  actuate  the water spray flow rate between
0.02 kg/s and 0.003 kg/s for a relative humidity of 40%  and
60% respectively.

     A summer  simulation  was  then  conducted  during  the
period  from  the  17th  July until 18th July using an ESP-r
test climate file.  The simulation time-steps were chosen to
be  15 mins for the building simulation and 1 minute for the
plant simulation.  It can be concluded from this  simulation
that  considering  a  temperature  sensor  as a component is
important for the determination of correct heating and cool-
ing  set  points  when  more  strict  temperature control is
required.
