	   Ventilation system with heat recovery

     In order to simulate a system as close as possible to a
real  system, in which building, plant and flows are coupled
together, the detailed ventilation system, provided  as  one
of the exemplars, was coupled to a three zone building and a
fluid flow network was defined for the building/plant  prob-
lem. This building is one of ESP-r's test cases and consists
of a reception zone, an office zone and a roof space zone.

     Two networks are shown, the one at the  top  represents
the  fluid  flow  network  and  the one at the bottom is the
plant network.  The dashed arrows indicate which  flow  com-
ponents  are  mapped  to which plant inter-component connec-
tions. Note that the flow network also allows the air  flows
in buildings to be modelled as shown by the window component
between the reception zone and the north boundary  node.  In
this  example  it is assumed that no air flow occurs between
the two zones.  For this reason, no  flow  component  (door)
was specified.

     The coupling of the zones with  the  fresh  air  supply
duct  was  achieved  by defining a control strategy file and
using a building control function with control law 6  speci-
fied  for each zone. The controller specified for the heater
control loop was of the proportional type (plant control law
1) with a heating set point of 20C and a throttling range of
2C. The maximum and minimum heating flux was  4000W  and  0W
respectively.  An ideal sensor located in the reception zone
was also defined so that  the  heater  output  flux  can  be
actuated on the basis of that temperature.

     The mechanical inlet  and  extract  ventilation  system
employed  a  heat  recovery unit in which the inlet cold air
exchanges heat with the exhaust air  and  thus  reduces  the
heating  load demand provided by the heating coil. Component
11 being introduced as a heat recovery unit (component  type
120).  This  is a two node component model which expects two
external connections having air as the working  fluid  type.
The  heat  recovery unit has reduced the total heat supplied
by the heating coil from 3435.7 KW to 2942 KW, ie  a  reduc-
tion of 493.7 KW for the simulation period considered.
