   Multi zone air-conditioning system with VAV terminals

     Another variant of the multi-zone reheat system  is  to
replace  the  reheaters  by  variable  air volume terminals,
known as VAV terminals. A system with  variable  air  volume
can cope with changes in local load conditions by adjustment
of the volume at constant temperature. Such systems  consist
of  a  main central plant, which provides conditioned air at
constant temperature  and  flow  rate,  and  an  appropriate
number  of VAV terminals to cater for the local load changes
of each zone. Control of the air flow is usually achieved by
means  of  a thermostat sensing the controlled zone air tem-
perature and a controller acts to modify the  flow  rate  in
the  VAV  terminals. A plant network of this type was set up
by replacing the reheaters in the previous example with  air
dampers and was coupled to the same zones (ie. reception and
office). In order to allow for air flow rate control in  the
dampers,  a  fluid flow network was also set up and included
two general flow corrector components (type 410).  The  con-
trol  on  the  dampers  allowed them to be fully open if the
zones temperature falls below 19C and 10% open if  the  tem-
perature  is  above  24C. This control strategy was selected
for winter conditions.

     A winter simulation was carried out  for  the  combined
building/plant  model.  The simulation period considered was
for the 1st February using  ESP-r  test  climate  file.  The
simulation  was  conducted  for  a  building time-step of 10
minutes and a plant time-step of 2 minutes.

The results from this  simulation  show  that  the  building
zones  are  catered  for  by  the  appropriate  VAV terminal
according to the load requirements of that zone.
