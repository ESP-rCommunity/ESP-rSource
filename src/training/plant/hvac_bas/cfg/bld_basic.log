Notes on basic 3 zone building used with basic hvac networks:

This set of files is an example of a basic multi-zone
building  representation.  There are several variant
configurations in this directory which add in additional
assessments using plant components.

The problem comprises the following files.

    file                       description
____________________________________________________________
cfg/bld_basic.cfg-onoff  model with on-off control implemented
cfg/bld_basic.cfg-pid    model with PID control implemented
cfg/bld_recirc.cfg-pid   model with a recirculation fan
cfg/bld_basic.cfg        problem configuration file defining a basic
                         3 zone model.
ctl/bld_basic.ctl        configuration control file defining convective
                         heating and ideal control for zones 1 & 2.
ctl/bld_basic.ctl-onoff  using on-off control with plant components
ctl/bld_basic.ctl-pid    using PID control with plant components
ctl/bld_basic_recirc.ctl recirculation control of plant components

zones/reception.opr      zone schedules.
zones/office.opr
zones/roof_space.opr

zones/reception.geo      zone geometry.
zones/office.geo
zones/roof_space.geo

zones/reception.con      zone constructions.
zones/office.con
zones/roof_space.con

zones/reception.tmc      zone TMC files.
zones/office.tmc        

The ctl folder includes a number of control variants.

The bld_recirc variant includes a flow network with supply
and extract fans and mixing boxes.

The bld_basic_onoff variant includes a flow network but
for the rooms only.
