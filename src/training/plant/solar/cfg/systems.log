                     The building for this system  is  divided  into  four
                regions in order to cater for the different schemes imple-
                mented in this example. The first scheme  "a  direct  gain
                room"  uses  direct solar gain as much as possible with an
                oil filled electric radiator as a backup  heating  source.
                The middle two zones, "rad_test" and "heatexch", were used
                for the next two schemes  and  were  heated  via  a  solar
                sourced  wet  central  heating  system, while for the last
                scheme, the zone "air collector room" was heated by an air
                solar collector.

                     The wet central heating system is composed of a  10m2
                liquid  solar  collector feeding a nominal 1kW radiator in
                "rad_test", a fan-coil  unit  in  "heatexch",  a  variable
                speed  pump  (sensing collector temperature) and then back
                to the collector.

                     To take into account  grills  in  the  doors  between
                zones, inter-zone flow-paths were also introduced. Because
                there is no air conditioning in the model it was specified
                that  occupants  would  choose to open windows if the room
                temperature  rises  above  23C.  This  was   achieved   by
                representing  a window as a common orifice flow  component 
                and the window opening scheme is defined in a configuration
                control file. In addition to the window opening  strategy,
                the  zones  "heatexch"  and  "mixed_test" also   have   an
                extract  fan  which  switches  on  if the room temperature
                rises above 22C.  In combination, this would result in the
                extract  fan  being switched on first and then if the room
                continued to overheat, the window would  be  opened.   The
                user  has the option to describe the fan as a flow inducer
                with a pressure flow curve or approximate it as  a  volume
                flow component (for initial sizing).

                     Two  variants  of  the  air   solar   collector   are
                represented  in this example. In the first case, an expli-
                cit representation is assumed in which all of the internal
                and  external shortwave and longwave radiation and thermal
                mass is modelled. The temperature gradient in the  collec-
                tor  is  accounted for by using three contiguous zones. To
                operate the collector three nodes  have  been  established
                within  a fluid flow network, linked, along with a fan, to
                the air node of "mixed_test".  while this level of resolu-
                tion  will  provide  a reasonable indication of how such a
                system will perform, higher resolution can be achieved  by
                further subdivision of the collector.

                     In the second case, a single node plant model,  based
                on  the  flat plate solar collector algorithm described in
                the TRNSYS manual (TRNSYS, 1983), was used. In  this  case
                the amount of energy transferred to the collector water is
                evaluated by the algorithm and then  used  in  the  energy
                balance  equation to calculate the nodal temperature which
                represents the average component state.  The  single  pipe
                radiator  is represented by a dynamic two node plant model
                in which the capacitance nodes are coupled  to  the  inlet
                and outlet connection.  An eight node model is also avail-
                able but since this example  is  focused  on  the  thermal
                interaction  between plant and building zones, rather than
                on the accuracy of the individual  models,  the  two  node
                radiator model is adequate.  

                The  electric  oil-filled  radiator  component  in     the
                direct  gain  room   is  included  to  provude      backup
                heating   and  is  represented  by  a  single  node model.
                The  maximum  output  from  this  radiator  is  700W.

                While an ideal control could have been used, the choice of
                a plant component means that the time lags associated with
                the  heater  are  accounted for in full.  The heating coil
                component is represented by a 3 node liquid to air  model.
                The  first  node represents the solid material, the second
                represents the air and the third node represents the water
                in the coil. The coil is fed by the radiator return water.
                The water pump maximum flow rate is 0.055 $kg/s$ when  the
                collector  water  temperature  is  above 35C. The air flow
                through the coil is supplied by a  single  node  fan  con-
                trolled  by a proportional controller sensing the coil air
                node temperature.  The fan maximum flow rate is 0.06 m^3/s
                when  the air temperature in the heating coil exceeds 18C.
                The period selected for the simulation is from 25th  April
                until  27th  April  with boundary conditions from the 1967
                ESP-r test climate file.  The building time-step  selected
                was 15 minutes while the time-step for the plant was taken
                as 3 minutes.

                The user input for the simulator is as follows:
                  dates: 25 - 27 april
                  timesteps: buidling 4/hr
                             plant  5/building step

                 Set the plant simulation parameters as follows:
                   solver type: 1 (Gaussian with back substitution and no pivoting)
                   max iterations: 100
                   max control iterations: 100
                   relative error:  0.01
                   absolute temperature error:  2 K
                   absolute heat flux error:    10 W
                   absolute error mass flow:   0.0005 kg/s

                     If the thermal performance of the solar  system  con-
                sidered  was  to be improved, then one way to achieve this
                would be to improve the response of the collector so  that
                more  solar  radiation  can  be  converted  to useful heat
                energy. This can be achieved through  the  application  of
                the sun tracking mechanism built into the collector model.
                Sun tracking can be implemented using  a  fixed  collector
                slope  angle  or it can be implemented using a slope angle
                which gives the maximum solar radiation intensity  on  the
                collector.



The solar heating system considered consists of the  follow-
ing components:

       Flat plate  solar  collector (ESP-r component type 700)
       Water  pump                  (ESP-r component type 240)
       2-node  WCH  radiator        (ESP-r component type 210)
       3-node  heating  coil        (ESP-r component type 410)
       air  fan                     (ESP-r component type  30)

In simulating this system, it has been assumed that:

-    Ground reflectance is fixed at 0.2 for the  solar  col-
     lector.

-    The  orientation  of  the  solar  collector  is   fixed
     throughout the simulation and there is no sun tracking.

-    All components are  located  outdoors  apart  from  the
     water radiator and the oil-filled electric radiators.

-    There is no friction  and  energy  losses  occuring  in
     ducts and pipes.

The pump deliveres hot water from the solar collector  to  a
radiator located in building zone 2 (rad_test). The returned
water is still warm enough to be used in a preheater  (heat-
ing  coil)  through  which return air from zone 3 (heatexch)
flows and exchanges heat with the radiator return water. The
water from the preheater is then pupmped back to the collec-
tor to repeat the water cycle. In addition to the plant sys-
tem  components mentioned above, there is also an oil-filled
electric radiator (ESP-r component type 280) located in zone
1 (direct_gain). This radiator is controlled such that it is
operating within its control loop settings between  8  hours
and 17 hours daily.

     The solar collector used has an area  of  10  m^2.  The
inclination angle (measured from the ground to the collector
surface normal) was taken as 50 degrees and  ground  reflec-
tance  was  assumed  to  be 0.2. The period selected for the
simulation was arbitrarily chosen  to  be  from  25th  April
until  27th April with a building time-step being 30 minutes
and the plant time-step being 90 seconds. The  climate  file
used  was 'clm67'. The complete set of parameters associated
with each component is given in appendix z.

     Three control loops were specified for  three  diferent
components.  One  for  the pump, one for the fan and one for
the electric radiator. The control loop for  the  pump  con-
sists of a sensor sensing the water temperature in the solar
collector and uses a proportional control law to actuate the
pump  water  flow rate. Minimum water flow rate is delivered
by the pump (0.001 kg/s) if the  water  temperature  in  the
solar  collector is below 25 (C). Maximum water flow rate is
delivered (0.055 kg/s) if the solar collector water tempera-
ture  is above 35 (C). The control loop for the fan consists
of a sensor sensing the air temperature in the heating  coil
and  a  proportional controller used to actuate the fan flow
rate. The fan is switched off if the sensed  temperature  is
below  12.5  (C)  and  it  deliveres maximum flow rate (0.06
m3/s) if the temperature is a bove 17.5 (C).  The  loop  for
the oil filled radiator consists of a sensor located in zone
1 and sensing zone air temperature and uses  a  proportional
controller  to  actuate  the  electrical energy input to the
radiator to 700 (W) if the zone temperature is below 18  (C)
and to zero (W) if the zone temperature is above 20 (C).

used.
