Detailed ventilation system

The most common ventilation system used in practice is
of the mechanical inlet and extract type. This implies that
both supply air and exhaust air are handled by mechanical
means (i.e. using fans).  This type can be applied to all
manner of spaces and is preferred to other ventilation systems
(e.g. mechanical inlet and natural extract, natural
inlet and mechanical extract).  Some applications include
smoke control in fire escape routes, kitchens, fume extracts
and so on.

In practice, the ratio between the air volume flow rate
of the inlet and extract systems are selected to suit the
particular application. For instance, in  normal living
and working spaces where no noxious fumes are generated,
the extract volume is usually arranged to be less by
10-20% than that provided by the inlet system. In cases
where fumes might be generated in a space, the balance
would be reversed so that the inlet volume is less by 10-20%
than that handled by the extract system. The former
arrangement was applied to this system.

The system comprises a suction fan (component 8), an
exhaust fan (component 5), a heating coil (component 9) and
some ducting arrangement. The heating coil used is of type
50 which has the heating flux as the control variable. A
control loop with control law 1 was defined in proportional
control mode to actuate the coil heating flux based on the
component 11 air temperature. The heating set point for this
controller was set to 20degC with a throttling range of
3degC and the maximum and minimum heating flux was set
to be 6000W and 0W respectively.

Components 11 and 12 are used as a building-like load
generator (type 910) in which a control variable exists to
act as the building load. Although the building load can be
introduced as time dependent, in this example it was assumed
constant with a value of -500W for component 11 and -1000W
for component 12, the negative sign indicating a heat loss.

A simulation for the period between 9 Jan and  11 Jan
was conducted using ESP-r test climate file with a
simulation time-step of 15 minutes.
