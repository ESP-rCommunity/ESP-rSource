Notes: This is the standard side-by-side office model which
has been upgraded to include explicit representations of
thermophysical clutter in the room.

For example, back-to-back surfaces are used to represent
the desk near the window as well as the thermal mass of
filing cabinets. The visual volume of the filing cabinets
is represented by solar obstructions within the room (they
provide scale but are not thermally active). 

Some of the walls and floors have been subdivided into
separate strips to allow for temperature variations
along the walls or floor to be captured.
_____________________________
 
The model is located at latitude   46.00 with a longitude difference of   0.00
from the local time meridian. The year used in simulations is 2000 and
weekends occur on Saturday and Sunday.
The site exposure is typical city centre and the ground reflectance is 0.20.
