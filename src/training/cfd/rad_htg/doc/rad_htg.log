DEMONSTRATION OF THE COMBINED CFD APPROACH

1 - PROBLEM DEFINITION
    - Start esp-r specifying a standard ESP-r problem (rad_htg.cfg)

2 - RUN SIMULATION OF THE DEFINED PROBLEM
    - Run simulation over a period of one day.
    - Monitor air "room" temperature and heat injection.
    - Specify control file (rad_htg.ctl)

3 - ANALYSE RESULTS
    - read library (std.res)
    - show inside zone temperatures.
    - run script "show1" to see images related to:
          Comfort Conditions
          Surface Temperatures
          Zone Air Temperature

4 - INVOKE dfs TO SIMULATE ONE ZONE OF THE PROBLEM ABOVE
    - Specify file room.dfd
    - Invoke cgd (grid visualization)
    - End cgd section and return to dfs
    - Specify file room.dfd-
    - run simulation and monitor simulation.

5 - ANALYSE RESULTS USING PHOTON
    - run PHOTON
    - specify results file (phi.dfs)
    - show velocity vector at the first Z plane.
    - run script "show2" to see images related to:
          Temperature distribution
          Velocity fields

6 - DEFINE PROBLEM TO RUN COMBINED APPROACH
    - define a combined problem (rad_htg_cfd.cfg)

7 - RUN COMBINED SIMULATION

8 - ANALYSE RESULTS USING PHOTON
    - run script "show3" to see images related to:
          Zone Air Temperature
          Comfort Conditions
          Temperature Distribution
          Velocity Fields
