These job.notes go along with case-, result- and temporary files
in which the Nielsen-case is dealt with for a non-isothermal case.

-----------------Marcel 29/06/95--------------------------

Description of the case:

   The case under investigation  originates from the 2-D test
   case that was described in the IEA Annex 20  final report. It has been
   proposed as a benchmark test for room air distribution models.

   The geometry of the test case has the following specifications:
   L/H= 3.0 , h/H= 0.056 and t/H= 0.16. The height of the room H is 3.0m

   The Reynolds number, based on the slot height h, is 5000, leading
   to an inlet velocity u=0.455 m/s.

   Though the problem originally was a isothermal one, and only
   measurement results are available for that case, a non-isothermal
   case was proposed in the mentioned Annex 20 report. The Archimedes-
   number was used for the criteria of the non-isothermal case.

   Through the inlet cold air is introduced, whereas a heat flux through
   the floor compensates for the heat loss through the outlet.

   Geometry of the problem

                                 L


Input variables for the first case:

   Ar= beta*g*h*DeltaT/u^2= 0.04

   beta = 1/293.15  1/K        DeltaT = 1.47   K
   g    = 9.81      m/s^2      u      = 0.455  m/s
   h    = 0.168     m

   This results in the heat flux Q necessary to compensate

   Q= DeltaT*u*h*cp*rho= 1.47*0.455*0.168*1006*1.194= 134.97 W

   This heat flux is put into the room via the floor.

---------------------------------------------------

The simulation was started, by changing the case-file case_2_gridVZ.dfd.

The following changes were performed:

  Buoyancy was introduced via 
#   Variables:
         V   W  T   K   E  Buo  

  The temperature for the inlet flow was set to 293.15-1.47-273.15=18.53'C.  
  Instead of a Zero-velocity gradient opening type, a pressure outlet (inlet)
  was defined. The temperature was 20.0'C
# Opening type   location   Ii  If  Ji  Jf  Ki  Kf   P(Pa) or m(kg/s)   T('C)
      Vel         South      1   1   1   1  19  20        9.082E-2      18.53

  The constant temperature solid boundaries were changed into adiabatic
  ones. At the floor the constant heat flux was introduced.

---Results

The first simulation was started as a steady one, with a high relaxation 
(V,W= 0.1), though there was no underrelaxation on the continuity equation.
 After 1000 iterations the relaxation was changed:
	P: 0.5      Linear
	V,W,T: 0.3  Linear
	K,E: 0.3    Inertia

Another 1500 iterations were performed (steady) with these figures. Though 
the solution was not converged, it was accepted, in order to see the
quality of the results.

(after 2500 iterations the residuals were:
   Res. of mass    = 4.720e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 8.498e-3
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 5.863e-3
   Res. of energy  = 1.089e-2
   Res. of t.ener. = 3.466e-5
   Res. of dis.en. = 4.159e-4

Normally the energy equation would not be regarded as converged. 
The convergence criterium for that equation lies at about 1.0e-6, when
it is normalized ! However this is not the case, her absolute values are
given
)

The qualitative results are more or less OK. Only at the outlet weird vectors
appear. This is possibly the result of using not the correct boundary
condition for the outlet.

Results can not be compared quantitatively because no results are available
for Ar=0.04. But also quantitatively the results seem OK. Only the pressure
is very high, and it is expected that this is also the cause for the
things happening near the outlet. In a next simulation, the outlet is 
taken as a zero-gradient one....

-----------------------------------------------------------

In the second try-out, the zero-gradient oulet was used instead of a
pressure outlet.

# Opening type   location   Ii  If  Ji  Jf  Ki  Kf   P(Pa) or m(kg/s)   T('C)
      Vel         South      1   1   1   1  19  20        9.082E-2      18.53
      Zero        North      1   1  20  20   1   4          0.0         20.0

Otherwise no changes were made.

The same strategy as described above was used for the calculation.


---Results

After 1500 iterations, de results looked acceptable, as well qualitatively
and quantitatively. The spurious vectors, as found with pressure cells,
did not appear anymore.
Convergence was not yet reached, and therefore it was decided to let the
simulation run for another 1000 iterations, and after that for another
1000 iterations. During these iterations, the residuals only showed a very
small decrease and the monitoring point showed constant values for the
different variables. However convergence is still not reached.

   Res. of mass    = 2.541e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 9.690e-4
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.357e-3
   Res. of energy  = 3.003e-3
   Res. of t.ener. = 4.585e-6
   Res. of dis.en. = 3.186e-6

Because the calculation is a convergent one, another 500 iterations are
performed, with higher relaxation factors for P,V,W and T.

  P = 0.7
  V,W and T= 0.5

The results after 500 iterations have not been improved, nor done very much
harm to the simulation. The residuals now are:

   Res. of mass    = 3.555e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 7.829e-4
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.006e-3
   Res. of energy  = 1.554e-3
   Res. of t.ener. = 5.824e-6  
   Res. of dis.en. = 4.401e-6

Because the monitoring point shows no sign of changement, the result is
accepted, and the results can be viewed.

The vector field and also the temperature field show reasonably well 
agreement with the results as presented in Annex 20 (However, those
results are for Ar=0.14). Compared to the isothermal case, the velocities
in the room are higher, but the penetration length equals that of the room
length. The pressure field is much different than in the isothermal case.
A stratified pressure field is calculated in which the pressure difference
is +/- 34 Pa. The influence of the buoyancy term seems to fade away the
pressure differences calculated for the isothermal case. In the isothermal
case the pressure distribution is totally different.

----------------------------------
----------------------------------
ARCHIMEDES 0.08
---------------------------------

A new case is started in which the Archimedes-number is enlarged till 0.08.
This case originates from case_2_grid_BUO_04_VZ.dfd.

In order to reach the value 0.08, the inlet temperature has to be lowered 
till 17.05'C. The heat flux coming in over the floor is now 270.86W.

{
   Ar= beta*g*h*DeltaT/u^2= 0.08

   beta = 1/293.15  1/K        DeltaT = 2.95   K
   g    = 9.81      m/s^2      u      = 0.455  m/s
   h    = 0.168     m
                                  
   This resulted in the heat flux Q necessary to compensate
      
   Q= DeltaT*u*h*cp*rho= 2.95*0.455*0.168*1006*1.194= 270.86 W

   This heat flux was put into the room via the floor.
}

############################################################################
When overlooking the results and job.notes again, a mistake was noticed.

The density is calculated from the temperature through:
   rho= 1.1881*293.15/(273.15+theta)

However in the calculations rho calculated at 18.53'C is used (rho= 1.194 
kg/m^3). This should have been (theta=17.05'C) 
   rho= 1.200 kg/m^3

The heat flux at the floor therefore should have been higher, in order to
keep the mean room temperature at 20'C, resulting in Archimedes is 0.08.

   Q=2.95*0.455*0.168*1006*1.200= 272.22 W

   DeltaQ= 0.5%

The Archimedes number can be recalculated from the figures above:

DeltaT ?
   Q=DeltaT*u*h*cp*rho=
   270.86=DeltaT*0.455*0.168*1006*1.200
   DeltaT=2.935 K
   Troom= 19.985'C 

Ar ?
   Ar=beta*g*h*DeltaT/u^2
   Ar=1/293.135 *9.81*0.168*2.935/0.455^2= 0.0797

######################################################################

The relaxation factors used were:
#   Relaxation factor type       variable       value
           Linear                   P            0.5

           Inertia                  E            0.3


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
One more change was made, but not to the case file, but to the code. The
turbulent Prandtl number for the enthalpy (temperature) was changed from 
0.75 to 0.9, in order to have a better agreement with the value found in
literature, and also used in Annex 20.

Another remark can be made on the turbulent Prandtl number for epsilon.
This is calculated from cappa, c1, c2 and cmu. This results in a value
for this number of 1.217. In the Annex 20 this number is stated 1.3.
However, because the determination occures according to literature, no
changes are performed on this value.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


---Results


After 500 iterations the residuals were:
   Res. of mass    = 1.719e+2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 1.491e+5
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.316e+4
   Res. of energy  = 7.914e-1
   Res. of t.ener. = 5.492e+3
   Res. of dis.en. = 1.113e+5
The problem was still converging, though the values at the monitoring point 
showed hardly any variation.

In order to have a better convergence, inertia were introduced. The 
linear under-relaxation factors remain unchanged.
          Inertia                  V            5
          Inertia                  W            5   
          Inertia                  T            5
          Inertia                  K            5  
          Inertia                  E            5

The simulation was run another 500 iterations (1000 in total).
The residuals were:
   Res. of mass    = 2.856e+0
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 1.822e+2
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 3.359e+1
   Res. of energy  = 2.621e-1
   Res. of t.ener. = 4.380e-1
   Res. of dis.en. = 4.220e+0
The calculations are still converging. The monitoring points has not
reached a stable point yet. Before changing any of the relaxation factors,
it is thought best to run the simulation for another 500 iterations.

The residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 1.276e-1
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 7.011e-1
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 5.451e-1
   Res. of energy  = 1.974e-1
   Res. of t.ener. = 2.024e-4
   Res. of dis.en. = 3.518e-3
The calculations are still converging, but one can see that over the last
100 iterations the rate of convergence is slowing down. The values in the
monitoring point are not yet stabilized.
To increase the rate of convergence, the inertia for the variables is set
to 10.0 (P is excluded, only linear relaxation).
The calculation are started for another 500 iterations.

The residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 8.093e-2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 4.153e-1
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 4.939e-1
   Res. of energy  = 1.030e-1
   Res. of t.ener. = 1.586e-4
   Res. of dis.en. = 3.298e-3
Though the solution still converges, the rate has fallen down. constant
values at the monitoring point have just been reached. The next move is 
to increase the under-relaxation values somewhat:

           Linear                   P            0.6
           Linear                   V            0.6 (was meant to be 0.4
           Linear                   W            0.6  was meant to be 0.4
                                                     no correction possible) 
           Linear                   T            0.4
 
The results after 500 iterations (total 2500) are:
   Res. of mass    = 2.773e-2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 3.742e-2
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.251e-2
   Res. of energy  = 8.816e-2
   Res. of t.ener. = 3.383e-5
   Res. of dis.en. = 2.706e-4
At the start of these 500 iterations, the convergence rate was decreased
untill almost zero. At the and, after 400 iterations, it picked up a higher
convergence rate.
Therefore no changes are made and another 500 iterations are performed.

{
Because the wrong answer was given at the question do you want to increase
the number of iterations (-NO-, should have been -YES-). The simulation
was stopped. The simulation is continued, by changing the case file
accordingly. This means setting of the latest relaxation factors and 
a positif answer to the question Re-initialize simulation ?
}

The results however now can be viewed, and judged on their validity...

The results are qualitatively realistic, and so are the quantitative 
results. 

After 500 iterations (total 3000) the residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 1.774e-2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 4.435e-3
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 9.039e-3
   Res. of energy  = 5.912e-2
   Res. of t.ener. = 9.194e-6
   Res. of dis.en. = 8.094e-5

The residual for the mass is not converging well. Therefore the problem
again is restarted, but now also for P inertia is introduced.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It is not possible to introduce the inertia for P during the simulations,
whereas that is possible for the other variables.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This will have a value of 10.0. Again 500 iterations are performed.

After 3500 iterations the residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 1.181e-2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 3.044e-3
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 6.235e-3
   Res. of energy  = 3.986e-2
   Res. of t.ener. = 5.530e-6
   Res. of dis.en. = 5.243e-5

Though the variables calculated in the monitoring position do not show any
variation, it is still tried to get a better converged solution.

For this, the linear relaxation factors are increased again 
           Linear                   P            0.8
           Linear                   T            0.6
          (V and W are not increased !)
and another 500 iterations are performed.

The residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 8.107e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 3.088e-3
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 4.308e-3
   Res. of energy  = 1.686e-2
   Res. of t.ener. = 5.023e-6
   Res. of dis.en. = 4.874e-5
The influence of the change of the linear relaxation factors is still
appearing in the Y-mom.residual. However it is converging and therefore
another 500 iteration will be performed, without any changes to the
relaxation factors.

After a total of 4500 iterations the residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 4.776e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 1.583e-3
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.678e-3
   Res. of energy  = 7.144e-3
   Res. of t.ener. = 2.138e-6
   Res. of dis.en. = 2.295e-5

The calculation is still converging and the monitoring point shows hardly
any variation for more than 1500 iterations.
Therefore, it is thought that with another 500 iterations the results
can be looked upon as converged.

No changes are made to the relaxation factors.

After a total of 5000 iterations the residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 3.466e-3   
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 9.290e-4
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.145e-3
   Res. of energy  = 3.034e-3
   Res. of t.ener. = 9.326e-7
   Res. of dis.en. = 1.246e-5

Though not totally converged, the calculation of this case is stopped,
because the problem is still converging, but very slowly, and the variables
at the monitoring point have reached a constant value.

ARCHIMEDES 0.12
---------------------------------

A new case is started in which the Archimedes-number is enlarged till 0.12.
This case originates from case_2_grid_BUO_08_VZ.dfd.

In order to reach the value 0.12, the inlet temperature has to be lowered
till 15.581'C. The heat flux coming in over the floor is now 405.74W.

{
   Ar= beta*g*h*DeltaT/u^2= 0.12

   beta = 1/293.15  1/K        DeltaT = 4.419  K
   g    = 9.81      m/s^2      u      = 0.455  m/s  
   h    = 0.168     m
          
   This resulted in the heat flux Q necessary to compensate

   Q= DeltaT*u*h*cp*rho= 4.419*0.455*0.168*1006*1.194= 405.74 W

   This heat flux was put into the room via the floor.
}  

############################################################################
The same mistaken, as was noticed at Ar=0.08, has been made at this 
point.
   
The value of rho should have been (theta=15.581'C)
   rho= 1.206 kg/m^3

The heat flux at the floor therefore should have been
           
   Q=4.419*0.455*0.168*1006*1.206= 409.82 W

---Results

The case was started with 50 iterations, to see if the problem wasn't
diverging at the start. After the first 50 iterations, the calculations 
were continued.   

After 500 iterations the residuals were:
   Res. of mass    = 6.703e+1
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 1.700e+5
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.398e+4
   Res. of energy  = 1.265e+0
   Res. of t.ener. = 4.697e+3
   Res. of dis.en. = 9.912e+4
The problem was still converging, though monitoring point showed hardly
any variation in the value for the variables.

In order to have a better convergence, inertia are introduced. The
linear under-relaxation factors remain unchanged.
          Inertia                  V            5
          Inertia                  W            5
          Inertia                  T            5
          Inertia                  K            5
          Inertia                  E            5
   
The simulation was run another 500 iterations (1000 in total).
The residuals were:
   Res. of mass    = 7.701e-1
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 1.723e+2
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 3.092e+1
   Res. of energy  = 4.254e-1
   Res. of t.ener. = 3.661e-1
   Res. of dis.en. = 3.588e+0
 
The variables at the monitoring point have not reached a stable value yet.
The simulation therefore is run another 500 iteration before making
changes to the relaxation factors. The problem is converging well.

The residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 1.108e-1
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 4.496e-1
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.619e-1
   Res. of energy  = 2.365e-1
   Res. of t.ener. = 1.366e-4
   Res. of dis.en. = 3.519e-3
The calculations are still converging, but one can see that over the last
100 iterations the rate of convergence is slowing down. The values in the
monitoring point are almost stabilized over the last 100 iterations.
To increase the rate of convergence, the inertia for the variables is set
to 10.0. In order to include P, the problem is restarted.

Looking at the results after 1500 iterations (remind, this is not a
converged one !), one can see the inlet flow dropping immediately when it is
entering the room. The flow is counter clock wise and the cold spreads 
over the floor from west to east. However it is heated up and at the east
side of the room, the isothermes show an increase in the temperature.
It is thought, that the result will be totally different after another
1500 iterations.

{
SOMETHING WENT WRONG, WHEN RESTARTING THE CALCULATIONS.
Therefore it was not possible anymore to use the results after 1500 
iterations, and a fresh start had to be made. In order to reach the same
point again, the calculation were performed as desribed above.

Only this time the inertia for P is added to the relaxation factors, so
that it (hopefully) will ask for it when changing the relaxation factors

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In the file cfdat.F one can introduce the inertia for P. However, 
the false time step is not used in the subroutine CALCP.

So effectively nothing changes after introducing a false time step for P !
See also the job.notes for Archimedes= 0.08.


Therefore, the restarting of the simulation was unnecessary.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
}   


The residuals after a total of 2000 iterations are:
   Res. of mass    = 3.860e-2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 2.284e-1
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 1.045e-1
   Res. of energy  = 9.041e-2
   Res. of t.ener. = 3.611e-5
   Res. of dis.en. = 1.231e-3
The solution still converges, but a constant value in the monitoring 
point has not been reached yet. The horizontal velocity is negative, 
which indicates that the flow still has a counterclock-wise circulation.
 
It is thought best the proceed the simulation for 500 iterations more 
to see if the values become constant again. Compared to the Archimedes=0.08
case, the calculation is converging faster when using the same strategy.

The residuals after a total of 2500 iterations are:
   Res. of mass    = 2.895e-2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 1.506e-1
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 6.512e-2
   Res. of energy  = 5.697e-2
   Res. of t.ener. = 2.884e-5
   Res. of dis.en. = 7.058e-4

The residuals donot converge regularly, but show a wave-like behaviour in 
total have a small convergence rate. The variables at the monitoring point
still have not reached a constant value. Especially V and W show also the
wave like behaviour found in the residuals.

It seems not wise to decrease the relaxation at this point, because it
could cause an instability which could lead to a divergence of the
problem. Therefore, again 500 iterations are performed without any changes
to the solution procedure.

The residuals after a total of 3000 iterations are:
   Res. of mass    = 3.099e-2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 1.032e-1
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 1.093e-1
   Res. of energy  = 4.586e-2
   Res. of t.ener. = 3.538e-5
   Res. of dis.en. = 9.738e-4

No stabiality was found within these 500 iterations. The residuals increased
over the whole. The velocity still had a negative value.

In order to get something happen, the underrelaxation will be decreased a 
little bit:

           Linear                   P            0.6
           Linear                   V            0.4
           Linear                   W            0.4
           Linear                   T            0.4

Another 500 iterations are performed:
   Res. of mass    = 2.003e-1
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 5.511e-1
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 4.933e-1
   Res. of energy  = 1.972e-1
   Res. of t.ener. = 2.706e-4
   Res. of dis.en. = 5.302e-3

Looking at the residuals, it seems like decraesing the relaxation was 
wrong. But in these 500 iterations the flow has made a reversal from
counter clockwise to clockwise. At least, this can be expected from
the velocity value in the monitoring point. Over the last 100 iterations
the residuals are recovering from this reversal, but they haven't reached 
the former values yet, let alone they could be smaller.

Therefore, the calculation is continued without further changes.
  
After 4000 iterations, the residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 4.489e-2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 2.273e-1
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.869e-1
   Res. of energy  = 7.405e-2
   Res. of t.ener. = 1.144e-4
   Res. of dis.en. = 8.699e-4

The convergence stil shows a wavy character. But it is thought that this
is caused by the fact that the constant value of the variables in the 
monitoring point have not been reached yet.
That is why another 500 iterations will be performed without any changes to
the solution procedure.

   Res. of mass    = 4.412e-2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 3.213e-1
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 3.369e-1
   Res. of energy  = 1.344e-1
   Res. of t.ener. = 1.086e-4
   Res. of dis.en. = 4.840e-3

As one can compare, the residuals have not decreased over the last 500
iterations. The monitoring point shows still some changes in the values
for P, V and W. Because it is thought that an decrease in the relaxtion
will cause higher residuals, the calculation is again continued without
further changes.

After 5000 iterations, the residuals are:

   Res. of mass    = 1.551e-2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 1.152e-2
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 1.858e-2
   Res. of energy  = 1.000e-1
   Res. of t.ener. = 1.132e-5
   Res. of dis.en. = 1.172e-4

So, finally the convergence rate has increased. This took part especially
over the iterations between 4500 and 4750. After that the rate decreased.
The monitoring point is showing almost constant values for the variables,
although P and W still are not totally constant.

By increasing the time step from 10 to 25, the convergence rate is hoped
to increase again. (false time step: 25, P excluded)

Another 500 iterations are performed, resulting in the following residuals:

   Res. of mass    = 1.107e-2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 1.282e-2
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 1.319e-2
   Res. of energy  = 6.878e-2
   Res. of t.ener. = 7.382e-6
   Res. of dis.en. = 1.032e-4

Though the residuals have changed, the result isn't yet OK. Therefore,
the linear underrelaxation factors will be changed:
           Linear                   P            0.7
           Linear                   V            0.5
           Linear                   W            0.5
           Linear                   T            0.5


After 6000 iterations, the residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 9.892e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 9.046e-3
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 9.604e-3
   Res. of energy  = 3.968e-2
   Res. of t.ener. = 6.236e-6
   Res. of dis.en. = 9.411e-5
The residuals for P, V and W are still too high to speak of a converged 
solution, although the monitoring point shows a stable V-velocity and
very slightly decreasing (hardly visible) P- en W-values.

Again it is tried to increase the convergence by decreasing the relaxation
through the linear relaxation factors:
           Linear                   P            0.8
           Linear                   V            0.6
           Linear                   W            0.6
           Linear                   T            0.6

After 6500 iterations the residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 6.771e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 5.061e-3
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 4.598e-3
   Res. of energy  = 1.714e-2
   Res. of t.ener. = 4.032e-6
   Res. of dis.en. = 6.754e-5

The calculation has a steady convergence rate and the monitoring point
shows stable values. The calculation is continued for another 500 iterations
in order to see if changes will occure.
After 7000 iterations the residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 4.169e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 2.617e-3
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.838e-3
   Res. of energy  = 7.158e-3
   Res. of t.ener. = 1.718e-6
   Res. of dis.en. = 3.321e-5

The calculation is still a converging one, whereas the values in the
monitoring point are stable.

After 7500 iterations the residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 2.895e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 1.341e-3
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.132e-3
   Res. of energy  = 2.929e-3
   Res. of t.ener. = 7.631e-7
   Res. of dis.en. = 1.400e-5

The calculation is still a converging one, whereas the values in the
monitoring point are stable. Therefore, for the sake of completeness,
another 500 iterations will be performed. After that the problem will be
regarded converged, when no 'strange' things happen !

The final residuals, after 8000 iterations are:
   Res. of mass    = 2.785e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 9.302e-4
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.085e-3
   Res. of energy  = 1.187e-3
   Res. of t.ener. = 5.258e-7
   Res. of dis.en. = 8.591e-6

The convergence rate is very slow, however it is thought that can be
increased by higher values for the linear underrelaxation factors. This
however is not done anymore, because the simulation already can be
regarded a converged one. This is subscribed by the fact that for the
last 1500-2000 iterations no significant (=visible) changes have occured.

ARCHIMEDES 0.14
---------------------------------
           
A new case is started in which the Archimedes-number is enlarged till 0.14.
This case originates from case_2_grid_BUO_08_VZ.dfd.

In order to reach the value 0.14, the inlet temperature has to be lowered
till 14.845'C. The heat flux coming in over the floor is now 473.32W.
           
{
   Ar= beta*g*h*DeltaT/u^2= 0.14
          
   beta = 1/293.15  1/K        DeltaT = 5.155  K
   g    = 9.81      m/s^2      u      = 0.455  m/s  
   h    = 0.168     m
   
   This resulted in the heat flux Q necessary to compensate
           
   Q= DeltaT*u*h*cp*rho= 5.155*0.455*0.168*1006*1.194= 473.32 W
           
   This heat flux was put into the room via the floor.
}

############################################################################
Again the rho used, was not the correct one. The value should have been 
(theta=14.845'C)
   rho= 1.209 kg/m^3

The heat flux at the floor therefore should have been
           
   Q=5.155*0.455*0.168*1006*1.209= 479.26 W
           
   DeltaQ= 1.25%
           
The Archimedes number can be recalculated from the figures above:

DeltaT ?
   Q=DeltaT*u*h*cp*rho=
   473.32=DeltaT*0.455*0.168*1006*1.209
   DeltaT=5.091 K
   Troom= 19.936'C
           
Ar ?
   Ar=beta*g*h*DeltaT/u^2
   Ar=1/293.086 *9.81*0.168*5.091/0.455^2= 0.1383

---Results

The case was started with 50 iterations, to see if the problem wasn't
diverging at the start. After the first 50 iterations, the calculations
were continued.
           
After 500 iterations the residuals were:
   Res. of mass    = 4.057e+1
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 1.738e+5
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.321e+4
   Res. of energy  = 1.568e+0
   Res. of t.ener. = 4.244e+3
   Res. of dis.en. = 8.951e+4
The problem is still converging, though the  monitoring point showes hardly
any variation in the value for the variables.
 
In order to have a better convergence, inertia are introduced and 
changed. The linear under-relaxation factors remain unchanged.
          Inertia                  V            5
          Inertia                  W            5
          Inertia                  T            5
          Inertia                  K            5
          Inertia                  E            5

The simulation was run another 500 iterations (1000 in total).
The residuals were:
   Res. of mass    = 1.007e+0
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 1.611e+2
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.868e+1
   Res. of energy  = 5.120e-1
   Res. of t.ener. = 3.228e-1
   Res. of dis.en. = 3.122e+0

The values at the monitoring point have, from their relative stable position,
increased (however their values were, and still are negative, so the
absolute value has decreased). Because of the fact that the value is
negative, one can expect the flow to be counter clock wise.
          
The variables at the monitoring point have not reached a stable value yet.
The simulation therefore is run another 500 iteration before making
changes to the relaxation factors. The problem is converging well.
   
After 1500 iterations, the residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 1.078e-1
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 6.604e-1
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.889e-1
   Res. of energy  = 2.257e-1
   Res. of t.ener. = 8.989e-5
   Res. of dis.en. = 2.650e-3
The calculations are still converging, but one can see that over the last
100 iterations the rate of convergence is slowing down. The values in the
monitoring point are almost stabilized over the last 100 iterations.

The horizontal velocity component is still negative, indicating a short
penetration length of the inlet flow.
Another 500 iterations will show if there is still a convergence.

The residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 4.272e-2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 2.728e-1
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 1.364e-1
   Res. of energy  = 1.182e-1
   Res. of t.ener. = 4.559e-5
   Res. of dis.en. = 1.801e-3

The problem is still a converging one, but the rate at which it is doing so
is rather wavy. This can also be said of the values at the monitoring
point. The horizontal velocity however still is negative.

In order to try to get a more stable convergence rate, the linear under-
relaxation is decreased
          Linear                   P            0.6
          Linear                   V            0.4
          Linear                   W            0.4
          Linear                   T            0.4
          Linear                   K            1.0
          Linear                   E            1.0
The simulation is continued for another 500 iterations.

The residuals after 2500 iterations are:
   Res. of mass    = 2.215e-2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 7.612e-2
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 3.381e-2
   Res. of energy  = 3.785e-2
   Res. of t.ener. = 1.836e-5
   Res. of dis.en. = 6.494e-4

The wavy convergence path still can be seen, but the frequency and the
amplitude have decreased. The monitoring point also shows sinusiodal
behaviour, but a demped one. The values are appraoching a constant value.
The horizontal velocity is negative, again indicating that the flow at
that point (+/- 3 m in front of the inlet) is counter clock wise.

The calculation is continued for another 500 iteration in order to see
if a constant value is reached and convergence still proceeds.

   Res. of mass    = 1.071e-2
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 1.462e-2
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 1.088e-2
   Res. of energy  = 1.891e-2
   Res. of t.ener. = 3.152e-6
   Res. of dis.en. = 1.949e-4

The monitoring point still show a negative horizontal velocity, which 
reaches a constant value. In order to improve the convergence, the linear 
under relaxation factors are increased again, reducing the relaxation.

          Linear                   P            0.7
          Linear                   V            0.5
          Linear                   W            0.5
          Linear                   T            0.5
          Linear                   K            1.0
          Linear                   E            1.0

After 3500 iterations the residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 7.447e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 2.970e-3
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 5.563e-3
   Res. of energy  = 7.301e-3
   Res. of t.ener. = 2.303e-6
   Res. of dis.en. = 1.020e-4

Though the problem is a converging one, this cannot be regarded the
final solution. Especially because a small increase (absolute= decrease)
in the horizontal velocity can be noticed, whereas the pressure remains
constant. Therefore the calculation are continued without any changes to
the solution strategy.

The resulting residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 5.574e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 1.326e-3
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 3.039e-3
   Res. of energy  = 2.841e-3
   Res. of t.ener. = 6.038e-7
   Res. of dis.en. = 3.408e-5

The convergence rate decreased to about 0 at the end of the 500 iterations.
In order to increase this figure again. The linear underrelaxation factors
are increased again. The values at the monitoring point are changing 
still a little bit. The new underrelaxation factors are:
          Linear                   P            0.8
          Linear                   V            0.6
          Linear                   W            0.6
          Linear                   T            0.6
          Linear                   K            1.0
          Linear                   E            1.0

After 4500 iterations, the residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 5.393e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 7.512e-4
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.140e-3
   Res. of energy  = 7.625e-4
   Res. of t.ener. = 2.556e-7
   Res. of dis.en. = 1.264e-5

Again, as described in the previous cases, the continuity-equation and the
Z-mom.-equation have difficulties converging. In order to try to decrease
the residuals, the false-time step will be set to 10, though this is at
the moment not possible for P.

5000 iterations resulted in the following residuals:
   Res. of mass    = 4.959e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 7.265e-4
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 1.820e-3
   Res. of energy  = 1.638e-4
   Res. of t.ener. = 1.284e-7
   Res. of dis.en. = 4.333e-6

The values at the montoring point have stabilized. This is also the case for
the horizontal velocity, which still has a negative value. Therefore one
may assume that the critical Archimedes number lies between 0.12 and 0.14.
Because the residuals still do not show a converged solution again some
changes in the underrelaxation are performed.
          Linear                   P            0.9
          Linear                   V            0.7
          Linear                   W            0.7
          Linear                   T            0.7
          Linear                   K            1.0
          Linear                   E            1.0
And the calculation are continued again.
After 5500 iterations the residuals are:
   Res. of mass    = 6.579e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 7.495e-4
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.054e-3
   Res. of energy  = 5.623e-5
   Res. of t.ener. = 1.275e-7
   Res. of dis.en. = 5.116e-6
So no gain can be seen yet from increasing the factors. However in the 
last 50 iterations convergence reappeared again. Furthermore, the values in
the monitoring didn't change.
Therefore the calculations will be proceeded without any changes to the 
solution strategy

Residuals after 6000 iterations:
   Res. of mass    = 6.032e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 7.138e-4
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 2.098e-3
   Res. of energy  = 5.270e-5
   Res. of t.ener. = 1.517e-7
   Res. of dis.en. = 5.768e-6

Values at the monitoring point are constant.

Residuals after 7000 iterations:
   Res. of mass    = 5.990e-3
   Res. of Y-mom.  = 6.798e-4
   Res. of Z-mom.  = 1.934e-3
   Res. of energy  = 5.107e-5
   Res. of t.ener. = 1.208e-7
   Res. of dis.en. = 4.640e-6

Values at monitoring point are constant.

Because an increase of the relaxation factor didn't result in much lower
residuals and because the values at the monitoring point have remained 
constant over the last 1500 iterations, the problem can be regarded
converged.

So no more iterations will be performed and the result can be looked upon
via Photon.

The results that can be seen, as expected, is one of a jet which falls 
down within short distance of the inlet because of buoyancy effects.
The penetration length is about 0.5m. Just beneath the inlet a small vortex
can be noticed.
The result coincides with the results Chen found. He calculated a critical
Archimedes number of 0.142. From the calculations one can expect a 
critical Archimedes number somewhat below 0.14.
