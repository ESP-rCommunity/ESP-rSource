_____________________________
 
This is the standard cellular office model which has been
extended to include a flow network with operable windows. 
 
Databases associated with the model:
 pressure distributions : pressc.db1
 materials              : cellular.materialdb
 constructions          : ../dbs/cellular.constrdb
 plant components       : plantc.db1
 event profiles         : /usr/esru/esp-r/databases/profiles.db1.a
 optical properties     : optics.db2
 
The model includes ideal controls as follows:
Control description:
Ideal control for dual office model. Weekdays normal office hours,
saturday reduced occupied hours, sunday stand-by only. One person per
office, 100W lighting and 150W small power.

The model includes a flow network including each of the zones.
There are four flow control loops defined to adjust flow at
the windows in the model.  It uses a range based controller
for the windows so they are almost fully closed below 19C
and above 26C. If less than 26 and greater than 21C the
windows open to 1.5x their normal area.
