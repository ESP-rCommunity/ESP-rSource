Notes on time dependent therom-physical properties

For a simple 3 zone problem, the conductivity of the
glass wool in some external walls is increased when
the internal air temperature rises above 20deg.C
(obviously not a real problem but used to demonstrate
the treatment of constructional materials which
are temperature sensitive).

An additional entry (glasswool_mod) has been made in the 
materials database (tp_subs.materialdb). This is similar to glasswool
but with increased conductivity. A new entry has also been made in
the construction database (tp_subc.mlc) called ext_wall_mod.
This is the same as for the extern_wall entry except that it
uses the modified glasswool.

The control file demonstrates the activation of the replacement
constructions.  For the space named reception, constructions
'south', 'east' and 'north', and for the office space, constructions
'North_w' and 'West_w', use the replacement construction whenever
the room temperature exceeds 20deg.C.  In the control file, control
function 1 (assigned to the reception) has a 'nested' control function
3 which gives details of the thermophysical property control. Similarly,
control function 2 (for the office) has a 'nested' control function 4.
