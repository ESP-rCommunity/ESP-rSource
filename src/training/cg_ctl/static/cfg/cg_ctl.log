Lighting Control using Zone Casual Gain Control File

The example problem comprises two rooms 4.0m wide, 5.0m deep
and 3.0m high with window on the south wall.  The room on the
left has control applied to the lighting system defined in the
zone operation file.  The room on the right is identical, except
that no control is applied to the lighting.  This allows
the efficacy of lighting control and its effects to be tested. 

In terms of lighting control ESP-r allows:

[]   The definition of up to 4 lighting zones within
     a  thermal zone, with a maximum of 9 sensors in
     each.  A lighting zone represents a particular
     lighting system.

[]   Vertical (unobstructed) and horizontal external
     illuminance sensors are available.

[]   In the case of multiple lighting zones, the light
     may be switched on the basis of the average or
     positional sensed condition.

[]   Illumination from adjacent spaces is derived
     from ESP-r's shortwave radiation tracking. This
     procedure takes into account the effects of blind
     operation.

[]   Provision has been made for user supplied daylight
     factors to be used as required.

[]   A range of sensor type exist to support coupled
     daylighting and atrificial light switching.

The control used in this exemplar divides the test
room into two portions and is applicable between
the 8h00 and 16h00 all days of the week.  The zone
near the window uses the split-flux calculation method
to determine daylight factors at four points and
implements a proportional control for half the lighting
casual gain.

The second zone is at the rear of the zone and is
based on a user defined daylight factor of 0.015
associated with the glazing.  Control of this zone
is based on a probability function.

The ESP-r User Guide gives further information on
the control of zone casual gains.
