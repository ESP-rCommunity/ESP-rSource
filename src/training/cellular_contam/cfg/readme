(Very high) Natural Ventilation
With 1 person in each of the offices similar CO_2 concentrations is
obtained in both the offices and with the natural ventilation scheme of
cellular_offices_src_nat.afn concentrations are low (libf1 and
occup1.gif)

But when there is a meeting in manager_a with 6 people in all
(meeting_a.opr) the CO_2 level rises in manager_a (libf2 and occup2.gif)
but stays low in manager_b (occup3.gif)

Most of the time flow rates are in excess of 300l/s which is an
unrealistic flow rate for such an office, this is obtained by fully
opening the windows (2m^2), with the windows closed partially (0.25m^2)
higher levels of CO_2 are obtained (libf3 and occup4.gif)

With a mechanical ventilation scheme i.e. with a fan supplying 8l/s
(fan_8lps) (cellular_offices_src_fan.afn) very high concentrations of
CO_2 are obtained during the meeting times (libf4 and occup5.gif)

So we need to provide greater ventilation using fan_30lps 
(cellular_offices_src_big.afn) and we also need to impose CO_2 control
so that the fan does not remain always on (cellular_offices_src.ctl)
control is imposed such that the fan comes on when CO_2 concentration
exceeds 2g/kg a simple on/off control is imposed. This results in lower
CO_2 concentration in manager_a which is comparable to manager_b (libf5
and occup6.gif)
