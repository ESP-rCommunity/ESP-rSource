Notes: This is a variant of the standard side-by-side cellular offices
which has been extended to support analysis of contaminate distribution.
_____________________________

There are several model configuration files in this folder:
cellular_contam_bc.cfg  the base case model
cellular_contam_ho.cfg  adapted for high occupancy
cellular_contam_mv.cfg  adapted with fixed mechanical ventilation
cellular_contam_mvctl.cfg adapted with variable mechanical ventilation
cellular_contam_src.cfg  with regulation 8 l/s/person ventilation

_____________________________

Details below apply to all of the models:
 
The model is located at latitude   46.00 with a longitude difference of   0.00
from the local time meridian. The year used in simulations is 2000 and
weekends occur on Saturday and Sunday.
The site exposure is typical city centre and the ground reflectance is 0.20.
 
Databases associated with the model:
