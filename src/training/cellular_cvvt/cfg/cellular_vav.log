_____________________________
Derived from the cellular base case model. Used to test
out ideal zone control law 22 which represents a VAV HVAC
system with fall-back to CAV for heating mode. 
 
Desired temperature in manager_a and manager_b is 20C
and in VAV mode the air flow rate throttles over a range
of 20ach to 5ach with a supply temperature of 11C and
a maximum terminal reheat of 700W.

The summer standard assessment shows expected performane
in mild weather - there is switching between VAV and CAV
at startup and at the end of office hours. The reheat
is undercapacity (intentionally) for some hours.

Note: currently the only way to find out the flow rates
used and the reheat required is to turn on the simulation
trace option for control.

This model could be used at an early design stage to
explore variants on throttling range and supply temperature.
