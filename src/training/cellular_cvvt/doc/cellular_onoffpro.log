_____________________________
Derived from the cellular base case model. Used to test
out ideal zone control law 13 which has separate on off
setpoints for heating and cooling with time proportioning
cycles on the heating and cooling.

The model includes ideal controls as follows:
Control description:
Represents separate on off setpoint for heating and cooling with cycle
limits. Heating on below 18C and off above 20C. Cooling on above 24C
and off below 22C. Loop 1 is for manager_a loop 2 equiv on/off
manager_b and loop 3 the corridor.
