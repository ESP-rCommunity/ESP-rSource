The model includes ideal controls as follows:
Control description:
Represents separate on off setpoint for heating and cooling. Heating
on below 18C and off above 20C. Cooling on above 24C and off below
22C. Loop 1 is for manager_a loop 2 equiv on/off manager_b and the
corridor (note how the two offices perform).
