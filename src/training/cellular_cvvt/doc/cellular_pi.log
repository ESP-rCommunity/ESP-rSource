_____________________________
Derived from the cellular base case model. Used to test
out ideal zone control law 5 proportional + integral
for heating and cooling.

The model includes ideal controls as follows:
Control description:
Represents P+I control for heating and cooling. Heating sp 20C with
2deg prop band and 10min integral action. Cooling sp 25C with 2deg
prop band and 10min integral action. Loop 1 is for manager_a loop 2
manager_b (with no integral) and the corridor
