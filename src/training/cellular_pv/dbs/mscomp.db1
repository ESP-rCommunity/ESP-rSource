This ducted wind turbine model is developed from that described in
"Development of building integrated wind turbines" by Grant, Danecker
and Nicholson.  The generated power (W) is calculated based on the 
following formula: 

P=(Cv/(3.3^(1/2))).rho.A.d^(2/3).V^(1/3)

Where Cv is the duct velocity coefficient, A is the duct frontal 
area, d is the differential pressure coefficient (Cp1-Cp2) and
V is the free stream velocity of the wind. 

The differential pressure coefficient is calculated by ESP-r or
calculated using a curve fit formula based on the user's own data.
If using the user's data then curve fit coefficients are required
to calculate d as a function of the wind incidence angle.

PHASE CHANGE MATERIAL
Special, phase change material should be defined for middle 
node of the layer in interest. Calculation being proced for
all nodes represented this surface.

Following informations are required to define phase change mat.
- melting temperature,          degC
- solidification temperature,   degC
- conductivity in solid phase,  W/m*K
- conductivity in liquid phase, W/m*K
- specific heat,                J/kg*K
- latent heat,                  J/kg*K

Phase change occured between melting Tm (PCM becomes melts) and
solidification Ts (PCM becomes solidified) temperatures. Below
Tm PCM is considered as a solid and the conductivity of the layer
is equal to conductivity in solid phase. Over Tm PCM is considered
as a liquid and conductivity of the layer is equal to conductivity
in liquid phase.

Beyond phase change temperature range latent heat of material is
equal to 0. In phase change temperature range latent heat is:
1 - constant LHT=b
2 - linear function of temperature LHT=aT+b
according to this two cases can be considered:
1 - latent heat is constant in temperature range (Ts-Tm),
    y=ax+b (a=0, b=latent heat [J/kg*K])
2 - latent heat is a linear function of temperature,
    y=ax+b (a=latent heat [J/kg*K^2], b=latent heat [J/kg*K])

*TEXT
This material calculated the heat loss and evaporation rate for
a saturated surface. The evaporation into the adjacent space and 
evaporative heat loss for the surface are calculated.

The functions used in the calculation are as follows: 

Evaporation (kg) - from the Lewis relationship: 

Ev=hc.Asurf.(w surf - w air)/cp (kg/s).

w surf is the saturated moisture content at t surf (kg/kg da)
w air is the moisture content of the air in the zone (kg/kg da)
hc is the surface convective heat transfer coefficient (W/m^2K))
Asurf is the surface area (m^2)
cp is the specific heat capacity of the air (J/kgK)

The evaporative loss for the surface is: 

Qev = Ev*(Hvap-Hsl) (W)

Hvap is the enthalpy of the vapour at the surface temperature
Hsl is the enthalpy of liquid water at the surface temperature
