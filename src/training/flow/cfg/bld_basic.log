Notes on basic 3 zone building:

This set of files is an example of a basic multi-zone
building  representation.  There are several variant
configurations in this directory which add in additional
assessment details.

The problem comprises the following files.

    file                       description

The model is located at latitude   51.70 with a longitude difference of  -0.50
from the local time meridian. The year used in simulations is 1967 and
weekends occur on Saturday and Sunday.
The site exposure is typical urban site and the ground reflectance is 0.20.
