Notes: This model is a portion of an office building in Ottawa
which has been adapted for detailed air flow studies via CFD.
_____________________________

The following configurations are included:
office_vent.cfg  is the base case with scheduled infiltration

office_vent_dfs.cfg includes a CFD domain for manager

office_vent_dfs_conf.cfg includes a conflated CFD domain in the manager

More information about the CFD domains is included in the model nets folder.

The common data for the models:
 
The model is located at latitude   46.00 with a longitude difference of   0.00
from the local time meridian. The year used in simulations is 1997 and
weekends occur on Saturday and Sunday.
The site exposure is typical city centre and the ground reflectance is 0.20.
