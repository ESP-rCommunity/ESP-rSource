_____________________________

This model includes several variants

3_windows.cfg is three zone model without a flow network
   (so that one can be added during a workshop)

3_windows_do6.cfg is the model which uses a graphic network
   file. Note: graphical networks are work in progress and
   needs further testing.

3_windows_do.cfg is the model which uses a text-based network
   file derived fom a graphic network file (equivalent to the
   legacy file)

3_windows_legacy.cfg is the model which uses a text-based
   network flow file.

The flow network includes one room with an air flow opening, a
second room with an upper and lower opening (e.g. sash window)
and a third room with a window based on a bi-directional flow
component (low wind speed with an inside/outside temperature
difference can result in flows).
