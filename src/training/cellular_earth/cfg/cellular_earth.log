This is a variant of the cellular base case model with
30m of 200x200 earth tube 1m below the surface. The
earth tube is used for ventilation air into the
offices.
_____________________________

This is an explicit representation of an earth tube. The
tube is represented by several zones connected in series
via a flow. The heat transfer coefficients have been set
to account for typical flow velocities. The bounding
surfaces are attached to bespoke ground temperature profiles
which represent the state of the ground below, above and to
the side of the tube.
