Notes: this is a variant of the standard side-by-side offices with
an attached corridor which has been extended to include a simple
hybrid mechanical ventilation system. Two additional zones are
used to represent a mixing box for each zone. Heat is applied
to these mixing boxes to temper the incoming air if required.

This is a synopsis of the model Cellular offices with tempered mech vent (via
flow network) defined in cellular_mctl.cfg generated on Tue Aug  2 12:39:48
2011. Notes associated with the model are in cellular_mctl.log
 
The model is located at latitude   39.18 with a longitude difference of  -1.67
from the local time meridian. The year used in simulations is 2001 and
weekends occur on Saturday and Sunday.
The site exposure is typical city centre and the ground reflectance is 0.20.

The model includes ideal controls as follows:
Control description:
zone control tempers inlet air from plant to manager_a & b to 18degC
 
 Flow control includes  6 loops.
Windows open and fan shuts down for manager_a when ambient temp is between 10
and 25 degC and room temp is more than 21degC. Manager_b windows closed via
controller, mixing box used during office hours.
