CHP Unit Feeding DHW System
----------------------------
Plant only simulation.

This plant network represents a CHP unit feeding a building WCH system
along with the DHS calorifier which supplies the hot water for the
building. For the sake of clarity the radiator system is not modelled
explicitly. The CHP unit supplies the total heat load for the building,
usually the CHP unit operates in parallel with conventional boilers.
Again for the sake of clarity these have been omitted and the system is
effectively running in a "base load" situation.

Plant Network
-------------
The plant network consists of eight  plant components;
 
* 20kWe CHP unit 
* 400 litre WCH calorifier
* CHP-pump
* DHW-pump
* WCH flow control valve
* DHS-pump
* DHW-converge
* bpass-converge
 
The CHP engine unit feeds both the radator system (WCH) and
the calorifier unit. The calorifier feeds the building 
hot water services (DHS). The CHP unit recieves the return
from bothe the calorifer and radiator systems. The core
of the system is shown in the schematic associated with this
exemplar. Neither the radiator system or DHS systems are modeled
explicitly.

The supply flow rate to the radiator system is 0.008kg/s while the
supply to the calorifier is 0.008kg/s, the supply to the calorifier 
can be changed by operation of the diverting valve. The return from 
the radiator system is at 71 DegC while the feed to the calorifier is
12 DegC. The DHS demand is 0.08kg/s


Control
--------
Two control loops are operational within the system. The CHP unit 
has an ON/OFF control regime sensing return flow temperatures;


                OFF
        _____________________ SPT HI 90 DegC 

        Hysteresis Dead Band

        _____________________ SPT LO 80 DegC

                ON

The ON/OFF control is active in the simulation from
7.00-22.00hrs, outside the this period the plant is 
shut down. 

The diverting valve on in the circuit is subject to 
proportional control sensing the calorifier temperature;

                CLOSED
        _____________________ SPT HI 80 DegC  

        Proportional band

        _____________________ SPT LO 70 DegC

             FULLY OPEN

Simulation
----------
The system requires a 1-day start-up to bring the calorifier up to 
temperature. It is recommended for reasons of stability that a 
minimum of 4 time steps per hour are used (the system in the exemplar
has been tested at 1, 10 and 30 time steps per hour).

Results
-------
The two main components of interest in the simulation are the 
calorifier and and the CHP unit. Output which can be recovered
in tabular format from res includes;

CHP unit power output.
CHP unit fuel comsumption.
CHP and calorifier unit temperatures.

The action of the control valve can be investigated 
by comparing flow rates in the calorifier coil (node 2)
and the bypass valve. The ON/OFF control action on the CHP
unit can be seen when comparing CHP unit output and the
return flow temperatures in the DHW converging junction.
