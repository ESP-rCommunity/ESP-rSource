_____________________________

This model describes a sports complex with a CHP and boiler system
supplying the air handling and domestic hot water systems. The model
demonstrates the features of an integrated simulation and incorporates
a building and plant system, an air flow network, power flow modelling
and a building lighting control strategy.

Building
--------
The building model represents a small sport center with a sports hall,
gym, changing facilities and a reception. The major loads for the building
are the heating load, hot water and the lighting load. The building is 
maintained at 22 oC and illuminated to 300 lux. Hot water is supplied to 
showers and sinks at 65 oC from a calorifier. The environmetal conditions
within the building are maintained by an air handling unit. 

At peak times the occupancy of the building rises to 200 people while at
quiet periods (early morning) this can fall to 

CHP System
-----------
The CHP system consists of a 36kWe engine unit connected in parallel with 
3 45kW Boilers. The total heat output of the system is 210kW, with the engine
unit supplying the base heating load and power loads. The base heating and power
loads. The engine and  boilers feed both a hot water calorifier and a heating
coil located in the buildings air handling unit. The power loads within the building
consist of lighting and the rotational loads with in the plant system (fans and 
pumps).

Lighting Control
----------------
All the areas of the building except the reception are subject to daylight
compensation lighting control. The set point being 300 lux. The lighting within 
the sports hall is zoned into 3 strips which run parallel to the main areas of 
glazing.

Power System
------------
The CHP unit feeds power into the main switch board which also is fed from the
grid. The swich board feeds a sub distribution network which feeds the main areas
of the building (main hall, peripheral building and plant). The building 
distribution system operates at 240V (phase voltage) or 415V (line voltage).

Simulation
----------
When running the simulation it is recommended that a plant timestep of < 30s is
used.
