Critical selection of glazing system for conservatory
in NHS Hospital.

The conservatory is occupied by patients suffering from
Dementia -> critical control of a direct glare and thermal
comfort.

Energy performance will play an important role for glazing
selection.

Glazing systesms to be considered:

Scenario	Description	U-value	Visible trans.	Total solar trans.

Base case	Clear double	2.80	0.76		0.71
Ref 1		Tinted+coated	1.96	0.39		0.28
Ref 2		Tinted+coated	2.10	0.24		0.22
Ref 3		Tinted+coated	2.06	0.20		0.19

As visual assessment of glare is an important factor the actual
gometry of the conservatory should be preserved when creating
its model geometry. This is reflected in level of details (glazing,
framing) of the model.

Model of the conservatory consists of:

Zones and dimmesions:
Zone		Floor	Volume	Trans

West_1		15.32	44.51	37.18
West_2		12.10	35.85	49.24
West_3		14.19	43.24	50.95
West_4		14.19	43.24	50.95

East_1		14.19	43.24	50.95
East_2		14.19	43.24	50.95
East_3		12.10	35.85	49.24
East_4		15.32	44.51	37.18

Week days 10:00 - 17:00
Weekends  10:00 - 21:00

West_1 (and like) - 300W - spot lights + 120W table lamps = 420W
West_2 (and like) - 300W - spot lights + 180W table lamps = 480W
West_3 (and like) - 200W - spot lights + 120W table lamps = 320W

People:
Maximum Total number of people 36 at any time
Walking, standing adjusted F/M 145W 75W-Sensible 70W-Latent (Radiant 58% Convective 42%)

Week days 10:00 - 12:00 (36); 12:00 - 14:00 (24); 14:00 - 16:00 (36); 16:00 - 17:00 (24)
Weekends  10:00 - 12:00 (36); 12:00 - 14:00 (24); 14:00 - 16:00 (36); 16:00 - 21:00 (24)

36 loading
West_1 (and like) - 3 person 225W-sensible 210W-latent
West_2 (and like) - 3 person 225W-sensible 210W-latent
West_3 (and like) - 6 person 450W-sensible 420W-latent

24 loading
West_1 (and like) - 2 person 150W-sensible 140W-latent
West_2 (and like) - 2 person 150W-sensible 140W-latent
West_3 (and like) - 4 person 300W-sensible 280W-latent

Heating and Cooling:

There will be convective air heating cooling system.
Mixed mode sensor measuring 50% air and 50% mean radiant temperature:
Week days 9:00 - 17:00 heating set point 20/(deg.C cooling set point 26 /(deg.C
Weekends  9:00 - 21:00 heating set point 20/(deg.C cooling set point 26 /(deg.C

Natural ventilation:

Window all the time closed if full air-conditioning
If naturaly ventilated case would be feasible - Window openning set point 24 \(degC.

Visual Comfort:

Visual discomfort will occur if the window luminance exceeds 8900 $cd/m sup 2$
[1]	CIBSE, "Windows Design Guide", CIBSE Application Manual.

Maximum direct solar irradiance at lower sun altitudes (winter months) is in the
order of 800 $W/m sup 2$ and would yield luminance of22800 $cd/m sup 2$. 
In order to reduce this to the maximum window luminance of 8900 $cd/m sup 2$ 
one would have to use glazing system with maximum 39% visible transmitance .

Sky condition selected for testing discomfort glare. Clear sky on 21 December
at noon (solar altitude 9.3 \(deg); direct normal irradiance 800 $W/m sup 2$;
diffuse horizontal irradiance 82 $W/m sup 2$;


MODEL SHOULD BE RAN WITH 5 MIN TIME STEP!!!!
