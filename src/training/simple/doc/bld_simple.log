Notes on simple 1 zone building model with convective heating
and ideal control:

This model (bld_simple.cfg) relates to an L-shaped office
reception with convective heating.  This simple representation
contains a single thermal zone, composed of 14 surfaces: 7 walls,
1 ceiling, 1 floor, 3 doors and two windows.

The heating system is 100% convective with an ideal control
which heats the room to 15degC from 7h00 to 9h00 and then
to 20degC until 18h00 on weekdays. Weekends are free-floating.

This model is also used to demonstrate more complex controls. 

The following files are used in this example problem.
