Notes on basic 3 zone building with global control:

This set of files is an example of a basic multi-zone
building representation with global capacity control.  
The global controller acts to shed loads according to 
the zone sequence specified, in an attempt to maintain 
the total demand within limits. 

The problem comprises the following files.

    file                       description
____________________________________________________________
cfg/bld_basic.cfg        problem configuration file defining a basic
                         3 zone model.
ctl/bld_basic_gb2.ctl    global capacity control strategy.

zones/reception.opr      zone schedules.
