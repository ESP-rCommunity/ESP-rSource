Notes on basic 3 zone building with zone temperature matching:

This set of files is an example of a basic multi-zone
building representation with a control which coerces
the roofs temperature to that of the average of
the reception (itself ideally controlled) and the
outside temperature. A more common use of such
`sensor-matching` is to ensure that an abstract boundary
zone (often used adjacent to the focus of a study)
is controlled to match the temperature of an actual
zone (which is considered typical). For example,
if an auditorium is bounded by 15 similar offices, only
one need be represented in any detail.

The problem comprises the following files.

    file                       description
____________________________________________________________
cfg/bld_basic_tm2.cfg    problem configuration file defining 
                         a basic 3 zone model.

                         convective heating with roof controlled 
                         to match average temperature of reception 
                         and outside.
