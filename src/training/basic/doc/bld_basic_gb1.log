Notes on basic 3 zone building with global control:

This set of files is an example of a basic multi-zone
building representation with global on-off control.  
Here the control strategy is that zone plant has ON status 
only if a specified number of zone controller outputs (in 
this case 2) are non-zero, otherwise all zone controller 
outputs are set to zero.

The problem comprises the following files.

____________________________________________________________
cfg/bld_basic.cfg        problem configuration file defining a basic

zones/reception.geo      zone geometry.

 Zone to contol loop linkages:
 zone ( 1) reception    << control  1
 zone ( 2) office       << control  2
 zone ( 3) roof_space   << control  0
 
 Global control includes  1 loops.
global on-off
 
 The sensor for function  1 sensors are not used in global controls
 The actuator for function  1 is actuation not used in global controls
 There have been  1 day types defined.
 Day type  1 is valid Sun-01-Jan to Sun-31-Dec, 1967 with  1 periods.
