Notes on basic 3 zone building with ideal preheat control:

This set of files is an example of a basic multi-zone
building representation with an ideal preheat control.

The problem comprises the following files.

    file                       description
____________________________________________________________
cfg/bld_basic_prht.cfg   problem configuration file defining a basic
                         3 zone model with blind/ shutter control.
ctl/bld_basic_pre.ctl    configuration control file defining convective
                         heating in zones 1 & 2 controlled as follows:
                             00.00 - 09.00 preheat
                             09.00 - 18.00 ideal control
                             18.00 - 24.00 free-float

zones/reception.opr      zone schedules.
zones/office.opr
