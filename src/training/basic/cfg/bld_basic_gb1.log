Notes on basic 3 zone building with global control:

This set of files is an example of a basic multi-zone
building representation with global on-off control.  
Here the control strategy is that zone plant has ON status 
only if a specified number of zone controller outputs (in 
this case 2) are non-zero, otherwise all zone controller 
outputs are set to zero.

The problem comprises the following files.

    file                       description
____________________________________________________________
cfg/bld_basic.cfg        problem configuration file defining a basic
                         3 zone model.
