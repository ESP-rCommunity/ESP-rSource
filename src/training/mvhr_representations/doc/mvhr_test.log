Notes: 
ESP-r supports multiple approaches to representing fresh
air requirements - from abstract to detailed and from simple
schedules through the use of flow networks as well as
plant components.

This model is designed to demonstrate the differences between
several approaches (descriptive techniques & performance
predictions).

zone manager takes fresh air from zone zero at standard rate (1ach).

zone man_redinf takes a reduced fresh air from zone zero to reflect
   the efficiency of the mvhr (0.2ach).

zone man_explic take air (1ach) at 0.0C in zone zero via the mvhr_rightb 
   mvhr_righta mvhr_right zones (representing the inlet stream of 
   a heat exchanger) with room air leaving via mvhr_left mvhr_lefta 
   mvhr_leftb and then to the exhaust zone.  Heat transfer coefficients
   are set to enforce strong surface transfer. 

zone man_plt uses plant components to define ducting and a heater as
   well as a generic heat exchanger (sensible efficacy description).
   See the model contents report for details of the system.

The flow network has constant volume flow rate components:
fan_40.5 - equivalent to 1ach of fresh air
fan_8.1  - equivalent to 0.2ach of fresh air (approximates 80% heat exchanger)
