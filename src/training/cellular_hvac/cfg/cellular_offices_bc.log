_____________________________

The basic cellular office model has been extended to be serviced
by component based HVAC.

Two zone controls link to HVAC components.
 
Plant control includes  6 loops.
PID control of flux injection of heating coil cooling at cooling coil and the
fans low rate flows 0h00-7h00 and after 18h00
 
The model includes a plant network with 18 components from plantc.db1
