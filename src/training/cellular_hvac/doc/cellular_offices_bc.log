_____________________________

The basic cellular office model has been extended to be serviced
by component based HVAC.

Two zone controls link to HVAC components.
 
Plant control includes  6 loops.
PID control of flux injection of heating coil cooling at cooling coil and the
fans low rate flows 0h00-7h00 and after 18h00
 
The model includes a plant network with 18 components from plantc.db1
 
 
Databases associated with the model:
 standard pressure distr: pressc.db1
 materials              : cellular.materialdb
 constructions          : ../dbs/cellular.constrdb
 standard plant comp    : plantc.db1
 standard event profiles: profiles.db1.a
 standard optical prop  : optics.db2
 standard UK NCM data   : SBEM.db1
