            Notes on PID control.

*************
Two of the three zones have control schemes imposed 
while the third zone is 'free-floating'. The simulation period 
is 9/7/67 - 10/7/67, with ideal control imposed on the 
first day; PID control imposed on the second.
************* 
There are two PID control loops defined: one for 
heating, the other for cooling. 
There are also configuration and control
files for 'steady-state' conditions.
*************

The PID model is pid.cfg

The steady state model is pid.ss.cfg

The following are common definitions:
 
The model is located at latitude   51.70 with a longitude difference of  -0.50
from the local time meridian. The year used in simulations is 1967 and
weekends occur on Saturday and Sunday.
The site exposure is typical urban site and the ground reflectance is 0.20.
 
Databases associated with the model:
 pressure distributions : pressc.db1
 materials              : /usr/esru/esp-r/databases/material.db3.a
 constructions          : /usr/esru/esp-r/databases/multicon.db3
 plant components       : plantc.db1
 event profiles         : /usr/esru/esp-r/databases/profiles.db1.a
 optical properties     : optics.db2
 
The model includes a plant network. The plant network contains 12 components from plantc.db1
