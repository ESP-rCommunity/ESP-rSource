            Notes on PID control.

*************
Two of the three zones have control schemes imposed 
while the third zone is 'free-floating'. The simulation period 
is 9/7/67 - 10/7/67, with ideal control imposed on the 
first day; PID control imposed on the second.
************* 
There are two PID control loops defined: one for 
heating, the other for cooling. 
There are also configuration and control
files for 'steady-state' conditions.
