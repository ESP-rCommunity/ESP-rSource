3. OBTAINING ESP-r.

ESP-r is distributed in two forms:
   i) precompiled binaries, and
  ii) version-controlled source code.

Using the precompiled binaries is the easiest way to get ESP-r up and
running, but you'll need the source code if you wish to modify ESP-r
and contribute your changes to the community.


Precompiled binaries
---------------------
Precompiled binaries for Linux, Cygwin, Mac OSX and Microsoft Windows
are available at:

   ftp://ftp.strath.ac.uk/Esru_public/


Version-controlled source code
------------------------------
The ESP-r source code is stored on a publicly-accessible Subversion
repository, called 'ESP-r Central'.

You can learn more about accessing the ESP-r subversion repository here:

   http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Programs/ESP-r_central.htm

Source code for the current release can be downloaded using the subversion
command:

   svn checkout https://espr.svn.cvsdude.com/esp-r/trunk/

Source code for the latest 'development' version of ESP-r can be
downloaded using the subversion command

   svn checkout https://espr.svn.cvsdude.com/esp-r/branches/development_branch

Should you wish to contribute improvements to the archive, you'll also
need a developer's account. Contact Alex Ferguson (aferguso@nrcan.gc.ca)
or Bart Lomanowski (blomanow@nrcan.gc.ca) to arrange one.


===========================================================
4. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

ESP-r has been installed Solaris, Linux, Cygwin, MinGW and MAC
OS X systems, using a variety of compiler and graphics library
combinations. Some of these configurations have been thoroughly tested
and are regarded as 'stable', while others remain in beta testing.

While ESP-r has been built on all of the supported platforms and
configurations, it is most routinely used on Linux.  Installation on
common Linux distributions (including Ubuntu, Mandrake, Redhat/Fedora and
Gentoo) using the gcc 3.4 and gcc 4.1 compiler suites has proven robust,
and you can use it with confidence on these systems.

ESP-r is used less often on Solaris, Cygwin, MinGW and OS X systems. These
systems are not be available to some ESP-r developers, and some (such
as MinGW) provide no standard environment on which ESP-r developers
can rely to ensure the software functions correctly.  Moreover, some
compilers suites, including gcc 4.2 and Intel 10.0 have proven erratic
with the ESP-r source base. While every effort is made to assure the
quality of ESP-r on these platforms, it may not perform as expected
with these systems and compilers. Should you wish to use ESP-r on a
non-Linux platform or with the gcc 4.2+ / Intel compiler suites, please
review Section 10: "RELEASE TESTING", below. There, you will find an
up-to-date description of the status of ESP-r on each platform.


Architectures
-------------
ESP-r is presently only supported on 32 bit systems.
Installations on MinGW and OS X are regarded as 'beta'.

 -----------------------------------------------------------
                      Solaris  Linux   Cygwin  MinGW    OS X

 -----------------------------------------------------------
 S = Stable
 B = Beta testing
 X = Not supported
 - = Not applicable

Compilers
---------
Compilation of ESP-r is presently only supported with
the following compiler sets:
  - GCC 3.4 (gcc, g++ and g77)
  - GCC 4.1 (gcc, g++ and gfortran)
  - Sun cc / f90

Of these, The GCC 4.1 compiler has proven the most robust. For this
reason, it is the recommended compiler for building ESP-r.

ESP-r also builds with the GNU GCC 4.2+ and Intel 10.0 compiler suites
on Linux, but these combinations behave unexpectedly in some situations
Until these issues are resolved, use of GCC 4.2+ and Intel builds is
recommended only for testing purposes.

 ---------------------------------------------------------

Graphics libraries
------------------
Traditionally, ESP-r incorporated an X11-based graphical interface and
could also be built as a text-only shell application. Work is presently
underway to modernize the ESP-r interface using the GTK interface,
and GTK versions of ESP-r can be installed on all platforms provided
the GTK libraries are available.

===========================================================
5. OPTIONAL FEATURES

XML & CSV output
----------------
By default, the ESP-r simulation engine (bps) writes out binary results
libraries that must be post-processed using a separate tool (res). bps
can also optionally export the results directly into ASCII XML and
comma-separated-value formats, provided the GNU libxml2 library is
available on the system.

If the GNU libxslt library is also available, bps can be configured to
translate the XML result file into any user- specified ASCII format.


===========================================================
6. INSTALLATION

Installation of ESP-r is managed through the 'Install'
script, which is located in the 'src' directory. ESP-r
can be installed into any user-writable directory.

The Install script provides interactive prompts to guide
you through the ESP-r installation, and also understands
a number of command line arguments. For more information,
run:

  $ ./Install --help


System-wide installations:
--------------------------

  1. Create a '/usr/esru' folder.

  2. As superuser, run the command:

          $ ./Install -d /usr/esru


Local installations
-------------------

  1. Run the command:

          $ ./Install -d <path/to/esp-r>

     Where <path/to/esp-r> describes the desired
     installation directory. For instance,
     './Install -d ~/my_esp-r' will install ESP-r
     in a directory called my_esp-r, in the user's
     home folder.

After installing ESP-r, be sure to update your PATH
environment variable as described below.

===========================================================
7. POST INSTALLATION CONFIGURATION

On most Linux and Cygwin systems, the only post-installation
configuration required is updating the path environment
variable to include the location of ESP-r binaries. 


Updating your PATH
------------------
You'll need to update your PATH environment variable to
include the location of your ESP-r binaries. The steps
required to configure your path depend on the shell in
use on your system. Enter the command:

  $ echo $SHELL

Configuration of the PATH environment variable using the
bash and csh shells are described below. Information on
setting environment variables for other shell types (e.g.,
sh, zsh, ksh) is available on the Internet.

  BASH:

      Append the following line to your .bashrc file in
      your home directory (or in the system's .bashrc file)

      export PATH="<path/to/esp-r>/esp-r/bin/:$PATH"

      (Where <path/to/esp-r> describes the location
      in which you installed ESP-r)

  CSH:

      Append the following line to your .cshrc file in
      your home directory (or in the system's .cshrc file):

      set path = ( <path/to/esp-r>/esp-r/bin/ $path )

      (Where <path/to/esp-r> describes the location
      in which you installed ESP-r)


Setting EFONTS environment variable
-----------------------------------
On most Linux and Cygwin systems, acceptable fonts are
located automatically at runtime. However, if you find
ESP-r crashes after invocation, you may need to set the
EFONTS environment variable. Include the following lines
in your .bashrc /.cshrc file

   setenv EFONT_0 6x12
   setenv EFONT_1 6x13
   setenv EFONT_2 8x13
   setenv EFONT_3 9x15

Default settings
----------------
The file <path/to/esp-r>/esp-r/default defines the default
settings for example problems, climate, control, etc. These
can be changed if the default settings offered in the
standard distribution are not appropriate for your site.

Colour Map
----------
To run ESP-r on some Sun workstations it may be necessary
to firstly define the default colour map.  This can be
done by issuing the command "xstdcmap -default" or placing
it in your .xinitrc or .openwin-init file.  With Solaris 7
you will also need to add "xstdcmap -delete all" to your
.xinitrc file.  If you are running OpenWindows and colour
problems persist, try commenting out the line

      cmap_alloc -allscreens

in the file /usr/openwin/lib/openwin-sys.


===========================================================
8. DOCUMENTATION

An extensive collection of books, academic theses,
peer-reviewed papers, reports and manuals describing the
theoretical basis and application of ESP-r are available.
A complete list of ESP-r documentation can be found on the
ESRU website:

   http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/publications.htm

Theoretical basis
-----------------
  
  - "Energy Simulation in Building Design" by Joe Clark
    (Butterworth Heinemann 2001) provides a broad
    description of ESP-r methodologies.

Application of ESP-r
--------------------

  - "The ESP-r Cookbook"  describes the application of
    ESP-r in building simulation:
       
       ftp://ftp.strath.ac.uk/Esru_public/documents/esp-r_cookbook.pdf

  - "Data model summary ESP-r Version 9 Series" describes
    the  format of ESP-r's input files:

       ftp://ftp.strath.ac.uk/Esru_public/documents/ESP-r_data_doc.pdf

Developing with ESP-r
---------------------

  - "Structure of the ESP-r Source Code Archive"
    outlines the branch structure in use on ESP-r
    central, and procedures for merging code:

       ftp://ftp.strath.ac.uk/Esru_public/documents/repository.pdf

  - "An overview of Subversion for ESP-r Central
    Users" summarizes the use of subversion to
    access and maintain branches on ESP-r Central:
       
       ftp://ftp.strath.ac.uk/Esru_public/documents/subversion.pdf

  - "ESP-r Coding Guide" provides guidelines for
    modifying ESP-r source code:

       ftp://ftp.strath.ac.uk/Esru_public/documents/coding_guide.pdf

  - "ESP-r Developers' Quality Assurance Checklist"
    prescribes testing procedures for contributers:

       ftp://ftp.strath.ac.uk/Esru_public/documents/QA_checklist.pdf

===========================================================
9. VALIDATION

ESP-r has been extensively validated both through comparison
to other simulation programs, and comparison to experimental
data. An overview of ESP-r validation studies is available
at the following URL:

    http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Documents/validation.pdf

In addition, ESP-r includes an option to automatically
perform the IEA BESTEST/ASHRAE 140 and CEN validation tests,
and report these results. You can exercise these tests
by clicking on the 'validation' option in prj.

===========================================================
10. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND RELEASE TESTING

Development of ESP-r continues, and its predictions are
subject to change as new features are added and existing
facilities improved. To guarantee the reliability of ESP-r
results, a quality assurance procedure is performed prior
to each release.

A comprehensive discussion of ESP-r prelease testing and 
results for version 11.11 is available online:

http://espr.trac.cvsdude.com/esp-r/wiki/PreReleaseTesting11.11

  a) Regression testing, which compares the predictions
     from two successive versions of ESP-r and determines
     if differences exist in the results.

  b) Cross-platform testing, which compares the predictions
     from the most recent version of ESP-r running on
     different platforms and compilers, and determines
     if differences exist in the results.

Since ESP-r is most commonly used on Linux systems and
has proven robust on this platform, regression testing is
performed on linux systems.  When possible, cross-platform
testing is performed using each of the other supported
platforms (Solaris, Cygwin, MinGW and OS X). However,
limited access to these platforms and the greater variety
of configurations exhibited by these systems limits the
amount of testing that can be performed, and ESP-r may
not install or function correctly on some machines.

The following table summarizes the most recent test results
on the stability of ESP-r Release 11.9 on various compilers:

                 Testing for ESP-r Release 11.9
      (2010-06-25, svn revision r5445 on pre-release_patches branch)
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiler          Status        Notes 
........................................................................
GCC   3.X         Obsolete      GCC3 was depreciated in release 11.6, and we now
                                regard it as obsolete. NRCan no longer tests 
                                ESP-r with GCC3, and recommends any developers
                                still using GCC3 move to GCC4. 
                        
      4.1.2       Supported     Formerly the reference compiler, GCC 4.1.2 builds
                                remain stable, and continue to show good agreement
                                with the Intel compiler (v 10.0). Version 4.1.2 
                                also agrees well with more recent versions of 
                                GCC4 (4.3.2 and 4.4.1). 
                        
      4.2.X       Unsupported   We observed substantial instability when using 
                                GCC 4.2, and the GCC community regarded this 
                                release as less robust than the 4.1 version. 
                                We have not undertaken comprehensive testing 
                                with GCC 4.2, and recommend developers use more
                                recent versions of the GCC 4 compiler.
                          
      4.3.2       Reference     Version 4.3.2 has proven robust and its results
                                agree well very well with the previous reference
                                compiler (4.1.2), as well as with gcc 4.4.1 and 
                                Intel v 10. Given the wide availability of GCC4.3.2,
                                we recommend designating it as the reference compiler
                                for ESP-r release 11.9. 
                          
      4.4.1       Supported     Version 4.4.1 also incorporates enhanced exception 
                                handling. When enabled, bps reports fatal divide-by-zero
                                errors, but preliminary investigation of these errors 
                                suggests they reside in low-level GNU libraries and not
                                in ESP-r related code. Thus, the utility of these 
                                improvements remains to be seen.
                          
      4.5.X       Unsupported   GNU has designated GCC 4.5.0 as stable, but it is not
                                yet available on our test systems (ubuntu & gentoo). 
                                It remains unsupported for this test cycle. 

Intel 10.0.032    Supported     Version 10 of the Intel compiler continues to be robust
                                as long as the default optimizations (-O2) are suppressed.
                                One test case (bld_hc_ISO15099) continues to produce small,
                                but non trivial differences for unknown reasons. 

      11.1.072    Beta          Version 11 of ifort exhibits trace differences from version
                                10 over many test cases, enhanced floating point exception
                                handling. When run with this exception handling enabled,
                                this bps produces fatal errors on models not previously
                                known to cause problems. These errors will be investigated
                                in the next release cycle. 

SUN   Std. 12     Unsupported   ORACLE now offers the SUN C, C++ and Fortran compilers free.
                                We have not tested ESP-r with these compilers, but plant
                                to explore their use in the next test cycle. 
                            
Complete discussion of these results is provided on the ESP-r wiki:
