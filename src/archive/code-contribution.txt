Summary of changes:
- Provide a one or two sentence description of each new feature or bug fix.
  Use a separate point for each new feature or bug fix.  Do not dwell on the
  details (these should be contained in the svn log of your sub-branch) but
  rather provide a high-level description that communicates the significance
  of the change to users and other developers.
- If this code affects simulation results, then detail under what
  circumstances.
- If this code affects the Project Manager or Results Analyzer, then
  detail this change from the user's perspective.
- If the changes will be transparent to the user and do not affect
  simulation results, then note this.
- If a new model has been added, then provide a citation to a thesis or
  a paper that describes its theoretical basis.
- IMPORTANT: Use proper grammar and spelling.


Testing summary:
- Successfully compiled GTK and X11 versions of ESP-r on Linux
  (GCC 3.4.6).
- Successfully compiled X11 version on Cygwin (GCC 3.4.4).
- Exercised relevant bps and prj menus for both GTK and X11
  versions on Linux. All menus found to work as expected.
