ESP-r Common Coding Resources

Summary
.LP
The source code distribution of ESP-r contains many resources
for the development community.  Those wishing to understand the
existing functions and subroutines within the Fortran, C
and C++ code base can browse this document for the API which
their code must interact with. It should also be possible to
use this reference to understand the structure of the code
and the dependencies within the code distribution.
.LP
Documentation of source code tends to lag the evolution of
the code and readers are advised to also review the source
code. As the ESP-r distribution is under source code
control (via subversion), it is hoped that this document will
be updated as the source code evolves.
.LP
This document should be considered work-in-progress. API details
are still being added so check for new versions of this document
regularly.
.LP
The source code of ESP-r is subdivided into a number of
topic-focused folders. Each of the folders separates the 
source files by functional task, data structure and/or 
analysis domain. There is a rough order within the
roughly million lines of code. There are chaotic corners 
which have yet to be consolidated and there is some
duplication which awaits consolidation.
.LP
Below is the overall layout of the source distribution
along with notes on the contents of each folder:

One key aspect of source code evolution is testing
of changes and the tester folder includes a number
of scripts to automate the process and over 170 
test models to be run as part of the formal testing
process. The tester folder are listed below:

High level goals
.LP
ESP-r is a mixed language environment. Essentially the
data model and the decision about what to present to
the user and how to interpret user actions is
handled in the Fortran source. The C code in lib implements
the directives about what to display and captures and passes
back user actions (mouse movements and keystrokes). The goal
is for the code in the application source folders to be 
substantially isolated from the underlying graphic API via the use of
intermediate code in the lib folder. There are a few exceptions
to this goal and the code relies on very few #ifdef statements
and direct calls to the underlying graphic APIs.
.LP
The source code and databases are held in
the src folder structure as shown below

The ESP-r API
.LP
Having reviewed the overall layout of the ESP-r distribution
we now turn to the details of the API.  For each of the folders
we will review the source files and the subroutines and/or functions
they hold. This section will focus on high level descriptions
and the Appendices will provide the full API.
.SH
The lib folder
.LP
The src/lib folder contains source code blocks that are so widely
used that it makes sense to compile them into libraries. Included
in this folder are a number of Fortran code blocks that act as
wrappers around the calls to the low level user interaction
API. The lib folder also includes the C source code related to the 
interfaces (X11 or GTK or pure-text) of ESP-r. 
.LP
Because ESP-r modules can be compiled for the GTK API, the X11 API 
and as a pure-text API there is a subdivision of the source code in 
the lib folder. 
.IP "esru_lib.F" 5
Code which is independent of the choice of graphic library tends 
to be held in esru_lib.F and this is included in all variants
of the library linked with the ESP-r application.
.IP "esru_libGTK.F" 5
Fortran code which provides an interface to the underlying GTK API is found
in esru_libGTK.F. In some cases there are differences in the number of
parameters of the C function, in other cases there are different C functions
which are called to carry out a specific task. The C source used by
esru_libGTK.F is esp-r.c esp_menu.c esp_text.c esp_ask.c esp_draw.c and exp_file.c
.IP "esru_libNonGTK.F" 5
Fortran code which provides an interface to either the pure-text or X11
API are found in esru_libNonGTK.F. There is a close match in the
names of the Fortran subroutines in esru_libNonGTK.F and esru_libGTK.F
but their details have been adjusted to the requirements of the
specific API they are dealing with (esru_x.c or esru_nox.c). 
.IP "esru_libX11.F" 5
This small source file provides a few wrappers which are needed for
X11 specific API and primarily calls esru_x.c.
.IP "esru_ask.F" 5
ESP-r modules include context sensitive help and for each module
there is a block of text which is held in esru_ask.F which provides
a high level description of the module. 
.IP "esru_blk.F" 5
ESP-r code makes use of Fortran common blocks and a number of these
are initialized in the file esru_blk.F. This is roughly equivalent
to the intent of the Fortran BLOCKDATA statement.
.IP "esru_fc.f" 5
Pure-text versions of ESP-r have no need for the graphic API calls
and also have almost no need for C code. The file esru_fc.f provides
dummy Fortran subroutines with the same names and parameter types
as the X11 API wrappers.
.IP "libXML.a" 5
One option for ESP-r is to generate XML reports of building and system
performance predictions. This is handled by C++ code in the cetc/h3kreports
source folder.
.LP
Conceptually, if the ESP-r community decided to support another graphic 
API, this would be  accomplished by creating another source file 
esru_libXXX.F to provide the intermediate wrappers.

The common code folder
.LP
One goal of the ESP-r development community is to have one
subroutine or function for each task in order to avoid
duplication. Facilities that are needed by multiple modules
tend to be placed in the esrucom folder and the relevant
Makefile for each module links to source files in esrucom
as required. For example, there is one subroutine that reads
a zone geometry file and this is found in esrucom/egeometry.F
and this is referenced by all the other modules.  Updating
egeometry.F and recompiling spreads new functionality to
all dependent modules.  The following files are found in
the esrucom folder:
