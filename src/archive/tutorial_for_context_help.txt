ESP-r has traditionally used compiled-in contextual help
text for user dialogs. Although this style (shown below)
does provide internal documentation, it forces re-compilation
of the module each time messages are updated and is somewhat
inflexible and pervasive in its data structure.

A typical standard help and dialog in esruclm/clm.F is shown below:
      . . .
      common/pophelp/h(60)
      character h*72
      . . .
      ELSEIF(INO.EQ.12)THEN

C Creation of climate file from manual editing.
        H(1)='Keyboard entry allows data for each hour to be '
        H(2)=' typed in for a given day.'
        H(3) =' '
        H(4)='Curve fitting can generate regular patterns of'
        H(5)=' data (e.g. provide a maximum, minimum and a sinusoidal'
        H(6)=' pattern is generated.'
        H(7) =' '
        H(8)='Transforms can change climate data by a fixed increment,'
        H(9)=' make a fractional change or a polynomial based change'
        H(10)=' or adjust wind speeds from particular directions.'
        H(11)=' '
        H(12)='Prediction is used for predicting radiation from site '
        H(13)=' position '
        IC=1
        CALL EASKATOG(' Creation of data via: ',' ',
     &    'keyboard entry','prediction','transforms','curve fitting',
     &    'continue',' ',' ',IC,13)
      . . .

Subroutine calls such as easkatog(), easkabcd(), easki() etc. expect
the common block pophelp to include relevant text so the H(1)='xx xx'
lines precede the calls and (typically) the last parameter in the
subroutine call is the number of help lines to display. In the case
above this is 13. If the text is edited or new H()=' ' lines inserted 
the numbering of the text array will need to be altered as well as the 
parameter passed to the subroutine.

Notice that common pophelp is a fixed array size (60 lines of 72 characters)
and pophelp must be included in each subroutine with a user dialog. The
usual indentation in the source results in fewer than 72 characters being
available for use in each message line.

A revised scheme has been put in place and implemented in the esruclm
module.  With the alternative scheme the above dialog becomes:
      . . .
      helpinapp='clm'  ! set once for the application
      helpinsub='clm'  ! set for MAIN
      . . .
      ELSEIF(INO.EQ.12)THEN

C Creation of climate file from manual editing.
        helptopic='clm_data_creation_opt'
        call gethelptext(helpinsub,helptopic,nbhelp)
        IC=1
        CALL EASKATOG(' Creation of data via: ',' ',
     &    'keyboard entry','prediction','transforms','curve fitting',
     &    'continue',' ',' ',IC,nbhelp)
      . . .

The actual help text is found in a file esruclm.help which is
found in the src/tutorial folder and later installed in the
esp-r/lib folder. The entry for the above topic is shown below:
      . . .
*item clm clm_data_creation_opt
'Keyboard entry allows data for each hour to be '
' typed in for a given day.'
' '
'Curve fitting can generate regular patterns of'
' data (e.g. provide a maximum, minimum and a sinusodial'
' pattern is generated.'
' '
'Transforms can change climate data by a fixed increment,'
' make a fractional change or a polynomial based change'
' or adjust wind speeds from particular directions.'
' '
'Prediction is used for predicting radiation from site '
' position '
*enditem
        CALL EASKATOG(' Creation of data via: ',' ',
      . . .

The text variable helpinapp is defined in espriou.h which
is set once for each ESP-r module in the MAIN program
file. In clm.F this looks like:
      . . .
#include "espriou.h"
      . . .
      cAppName = 'clm'
      helpinapp='clm'  ! set once for the application
      . . .

The subroutine identifier is the variable helpinsub. In
clm.F this is set in the MAIN as well as in each subroutine
which has context. In clm.F MAIN this looks like:
      . . .

C For help messages
      character helpinsub*24 ! subroutine name
      character helptopic*24 ! string (unique) for topic
      integer nbhelp     ! number of help lines found (will be non-zero
                         ! because default message will be created
      . . .
      cAppName = 'clm'
      helpinapp='clm'  ! set once for the application
      helpinsub='clm'  ! set for MAIN
      . . .

For a standard subroutine this would look like:
      SUBROUTINE RRITE
      . . .
C For help messages
      character helpinsub*24,helptopic*24
      integer nbhelp     ! number of help lines found

      helpinsub='RRITE'  ! set for MAIN
      . . .

The subroutine gethelptext is current found in esruclm/clm.F and
will be moved to the lib folder shortly so that it can be called
by other applications. When it is called it checks the value of
helpinapp to figure out what the name of the help file will be.
It then scans the ASCII file until a matching subroutine name
and topic are found. It counts the number of lines of help text
and returns this.  If no help text is found it makes up a 
standard message.

Preparation for a user dialog follows the pattern of:
        . . .
        helptopic='clm_data_creation_opt'
        call gethelptext(helpinsub,helptopic,nbhelp)
        . . .

where the helpinapp is already in common and need not be passed
to gethelptext. The two strings helpinsub and helptopic are
defined prior to the gethelptext call and the integer
variable nbhelp is returned as the number of help text lines
associated with this subroutine and topic.  The nbhelp is
then passed to easkatog or easki etc.

Thus editing of the text within the esruclm.help file for an
existing topic can be done without having to recompile the
application.  To test that the changes work, simply copy the
esruclm.help (or whatever the original file is) to the esp-r/lib
folder of the distribution and re-start the application.

The ASCII help file

Each application will have a separate help text file. This reduces
the time required for scanning and partitions the information.
The tokens in a help text file are as follows:

*help_text clm

This is the first line where *help_text is the tag and it is followed
by an indicator of the application it is associated with.

Next there are *item lines as follows:

*item MKBCLM confirm_marker_line

where the first token *item is followed by a word and a phrase. The 
first word is the name of the calling subroutine (or the name of 
the MAIN) and this must exactly match the word passed from the
calling code. Spaces are assumed to be separators between the
*item and the word and the following phrase.

The block of text takes the form of quoted strings. This allows
for leading spaces or blank lines to be represented. The
code reads lines until an *enditem line is reached.

In the above example the initial source line of the subroutine
that is using the help text is included after the *enditem.
  . . .
' '
'Prediction is used for predicting radiation from site '
' position '
*enditem
        CALL EASKATOG(' Creation of data via: ',' ',
  . . .

This is optional. It does help developers identify the relationship
between the entries in the *.help file and the source code.

How to prepare *.help files

There is code for a utility application named scan_context.F
which can extract contextual help from application source code
and do most of the work of formatting the *.help file.  The
code is found in the src/archive folder.  Compile this via
commands such as:

C To compile (use either f90 or gfortran):
C f90 -c scan_context.F -g
C f90 -o scan_context scan_context.o
C gfortran -c scan_context.F -g
C gfortran -o scan_context scan_context.o
C gfortran-4.3 -c scan_context.F -g
C gfortran-4.3 -o scan_context scan_context.o

Preparation for use of scan_context would be to identify
a source folder and use a cat command to gather all of
the source code in the folder into a single file source.F for
processing. source.F needs to be placed in the same location
as scan_context. If we were going to process the module esrumrt
the following sequence would be used:

  cd esrumrt
  make clean
  cat *.F >all_source
  mv all_source source.F
  scan_context

This would result in a source.FH file with contents like:

*help_text
*subroutine BOUND
*subroutine BUBBLE
*subroutine analytic
*subroutine BUB
*subroutine OBSTRT
*subroutine checkrec
*subroutine schryf
*item espvwf
*enditem
      call askabout('vwf ',1)
*item espvwf
'The model configuration file holds the definition '
'of the building/ plant to be simulated, including the'
'names of all of the files required.'
*enditem
            CALL EASKF(L144,' Model configuration file?',' ',96,DFCFG,
*item espvwf
*enditem
            CALL EASKF(L144,' Model configuration file?',' ',124,DFCFG,
*item espvwf
*enditem
          CALL EASKF(L144,' Model configuration file?',' ',96,DFCFG,
*item espvwf
*enditem
        CALL EASKGEOF('Select a zone to assess:',CFGOK,IC,'-',IER)
*item espvwf
'Variable igfact represents the grid sub- '
'division. Every surface is divided in '
'igfact**2 sub-surfaces.  A bubble is placed '
'at the centre of each sub-surface. '
*enditem
        CALL EASKI(IGFACT,' ',' New value ? ',
*item espvwf
*enditem
        CALL EASKI(NP,' ',' New value ? ',
*item espvwf
'The view factor file contains viewfactors between'
'each of the surfaces in a zone as well as MRT sensor'
*enditem
        CALL EASKS(LTMP,' Viewfactor & MRT file name ?',' ',
*item espvwf
*enditem
        call askabout('vwf ',0)
*item espvwf
*enditem
          CALL EASKABC('Problem reading existing viewfactor file :',
*subroutine CALVF
*item CALVF
'Please review the results of the calculations. If all'
'of the factors for each surface sum close to 1.0 then'
'a yes is appropriate. '
' '
'If there are some surfaces with low or no viewfactors'
'to other surfaces then you may need to increase the '
'resolution of the grid. '
*enditem
      CALL ASKOK(' Ok to save these viewfactors?',' ',OK,dok,7)
*subroutine imgdisp
*subroutine FILEIN
*subroutine ESMZON

  . . .

Post processing is required.  For example the initial line of
source.FH does not have the second token.

If you see lines like:
  . . .
*subroutine BOUND
*subroutine BUBBLE
*subroutine analytic
*subroutine BUB
*subroutine OBSTRT
  . . .
which have no *item lines this indicates that there is no help
text in those subroutines The parser will skip past lines
which start with *subroutine. You could remove such lines
from the source.FH file.

The next pattern is:
 . . .
*item espvwf
'The model configuration file holds the definition '
'of the building/ plant to be simulated, including the'
'names of all of the files required.'
*enditem
            CALL EASKF(L144,' Model configuration file?',' ',96,DFCFG,
*item espvwf
*enditem
            CALL EASKF(L144,' Model configuration file?',' ',124,DFCFG,
*item espvwf
*enditem
          CALL EASKF(L144,' Model configuration file?',' ',96,DFCFG,
*item espvwf
*enditem
 . . .

The same help text is being used by alternative calls to
EASKF. You can edit out the duplication so that you have only:

 . . .
*item espvwf
'The model configuration file holds the definition '
'of the building/ plant to be simulated, including the'
'names of all of the files required.'
*enditem
            CALL EASKF(L144,' Model configuration file?',' ',96,DFCFG,
 . . .

The next thing to notice is that the *item lines only has
the subroutine name but not the topic phrase.  Here is where
you need to simultaneously edit the source code and the help
text file. And, you need to define a unique (to this help 
text file) phrase for the topic.  

Lets say the code phrase will be: user_supplied_cfg_file so
in the source code we have:
        . . .
      helpinapp='espvwf'  ! set once for the application
      helpinsub='espvwf'  ! set for MAIN
        . . .
        helptopic='user_supplied_cfg_file'
        call gethelptext(helpinsub,helptopic,nbhelp)
        . . .
            CALL EASKF(L144,' Model configuration file?',' ',96,DFCFG,
     &        'config file name',IER,nbhelp)
        . . .

and the entry in the help text file would become:
 . . .
*item espvwf user_supplied_cfg_file
'The model configuration file holds the definition '
'of the building/ plant to be simulated, including the'
'names of all of the files required.'
*enditem
            CALL EASKF(L144,' Model configuration file?',' ',96,DFCFG,
 . . .


Once you have transformed all of the help messages in a source
file (or several subroutines) test this by copying the *.help
file to the esp-r/lib folder, recompile the application. Note
you may have to copy the source of subroutine gethelptext from
clm.F to the MAIN source file of the new application. You might
also have to adapt gethelptext to set a folder name for the
new application.

If in doubt look at the patterns with the esruclm folder and the
help file named esruclm.help
