C Quick run method: best week is found for each season defined in the year. The
C best week is defined as the week that best represents the climate for the season. 
C Time-step controller controls bps to run once for all the best weeks found. 
C The flag (iQuick_run) is set in the cfg file with the tag *quick_run
