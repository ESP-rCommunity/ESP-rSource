# SYNOPSIS
# This script does a global (all source related to each module)
# syntax check of each of the ESP-r module. Linux version.

# It is intended to be used during and ESP-r Install after
# all of the executables have been created but prior to
# the option to clean up the source folders.
# The script invokes forchk with options that allow for a
# range of coding issues to be identified and places these
# in a file xx.chk (it backs up prior xx.chk).

# YOU MAY NEED TO EDIT the script to supply the location for
# the fckcnf file that is used by the forchk tool.

# For eserubps and esruprj a file all_source.F is created because
# of the number of files is more than forchk can handle.

# The script also shows the last 40 lines of the report
# as it progresses thru each module (this is the summary
# section that may help you to spot whether there are new
# errors.

# This script is for Linux computers and expects that
# forchk is found in the users $PATH and that $FCKCNF
# has been defined (typically pointing to esp-r.cnf
# in /usr/local/lib/forcheck/
