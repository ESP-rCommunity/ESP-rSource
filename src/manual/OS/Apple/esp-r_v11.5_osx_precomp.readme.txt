
Notes for the self-extracting installer for a precompiled 
X11 or GTK version 11.5 of ESP-r to run on an OSX 10.4 (or newer)
Mac computer. It should run natively on PPC based Macs and in
emulation mode on Intel based Mac computers. It assumes that
you have the X11 environment installed as well as the development
tools.

This installer is intended to be used via either the OSX terminal 
(which supports text interactions) or within an OSX X11 graphics terminal.

Typically the `run` file you downloaded
should be placed in /opt and run via a sudo command from 
that folder via the command 
  sudo ./esp-r_v11.5_osx_precomp.run

On most OSX machines a file ending in .run will be
treated as an executable. If the installer does not 
execute you may have to issue the following command 
to change its permissions:
  sudo chmod a+x ./esp-r_v11.5_osx_precomp.run

There are two versions of ESP-r which can be installed. The
so-called X11 version is the legacy version and the GTK version
is an almost complete port of ESP-r using the GTK libary. There
are a few functions which are not available in the GTK version
so this is generally viewed as BETA software.  The GTK version also
has a number of library dependencies which are not required of
the X11 version.

The installer will ask you a number of yes/no questions and, if
successful it will place an ESP-r distribution
in the folders:
  /opt/esru/esp-r/
        bin
	climate
	databases
	manual
	training
	validation
	
and it will create a link from /usr/esru to /opt/esru

During the install process LOOK FOR DIRECTIONS for
adapting your PATH environment variable (if required). A
sample .cshrc file will be placed in /tmp. Once you
have checked that ESP-r modules run you can remove
the installer.

Once you have installed ESP-r:

To start up the ESP-r Project Manger, log into your computer
as normal, start up an X11 command window and give the 
following command sequence:
 tcsh
 esp-r
 
To find out what command line options are available
for an ESP-r module use the -help option with
the module name e.g. 'espvwf -help' (without the quotes).

Note: the ESP-r executables were created on a PPC powerbook
computer running a OSX 10.4. It should run on most PPC
Macs which have X11 and the developer tools installed. The
GTK version will require libgtk-x11-2.0 libgdk-x11-2.0 libatk-1.0
libgdk_pixbuf-2.0 libpangoxfg-1.0 libpangox-1.0 libpango-1.0
libgobject-2.0 libglib-2.0 libintl libiconv. 

If ESP-r refuses to run you might have to download a few 
packages via the fink environment (more about that in
setting_up_osx.txt). On Intel based machines it reportedly
runs in emulation mode.

On Macs with older versions of OSX you may get warnings
about undefined symbols. If this happens you are probably
going to have to compile ESP-r on your machine.

Full instructions for setting up your Mac prior to using
this installer are found in the file setting_up_osx.txt
