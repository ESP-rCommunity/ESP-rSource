Steps in making a self extractor:

First compile a standard version of esp-r (X11 version) in the standard location
which on OSX should be /opt/esru.

Second go to /opt/esru and create a tar file of the bin docs esp-r lib and tutorial
folders (the example below includes a date string in the name of the tar file.

Create a folder /opt/precompiled_for_osx

sudo tar cf esp-r_X11_11.3_osx.tar bin esp-r lib tutorial

gzip -9 that tar file and move it into /opt/precompiled_for_osx.

A similar process is taken for the GTK version.  Clear the standard location and compile
a new GTK version of esp-r. Create the tar file of the distribution and gzip it and
place it in the precompiled_for_osx folder and edit the setup script to
include the specific name of the file that has been giziped.

In folder /opt/precompiled_for_osx along with the gziped tar files
there are several other files as follows:

License (text which is used to advise the user on license conditions.
setup_osx (a script which tells makeself.sh what to do during the extraction
      process.

The file that does most of the work is setup_osx.  This needs to be edited
slightly to include the specific ...tar.gz files.  The other
files are helper applications that setup is going to copy.

The way that the self extractor is created is via a command similar
to the one below (adapt for your makeself.sh location):

sudo /users/jon/bin/makeself-2.1.4/makeself.sh precompiled_for_osx esp-r_v11.3_osx_precomp.run "ESP-r V11.3 distribution for OSX (/opt/esru)" ./setup_osx

The items are as follows makeself.sh is a general script that creates installers. makeself-2.1.4 can
be downloded from the web and it will create its own executables.  The command includes the full
path to where makeself.sh is located on your machine. The 2nd item is the name of the folder where
the files to be installed is located (as noted in the first step). The 3rd token is the name
of the 'run' file that is going to be created (a run file is the finished esp-r installer that
will be placed on the web). The string in quotes is a message that will be printed out when
the installer runs. And lastly ./setup_osx is the edited setup script within the precompiled_GTK_for_cygwin
folder. This script needs to have a chmod a+x done on it.

It is A REALLY GOOD IDEA to test use of the self-extractor on a clean machine.
