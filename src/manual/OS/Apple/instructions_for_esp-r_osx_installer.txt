        Steps to create or use the ESP-r installers on OSX
                             March 2011

Pre-compiled versions of ESP-r on OSX are usually distributed in
the form of a compressed tar archive of a newly compiled and working
ESP-r distribution.

Compiling ESP-r from source

First compile a standard version of esp-r (X11 version) in the standard
location which on OSX should be /opt/esru with a command such as:

  ./Install -d /opt/esru --gcc4 --compiler_version -4.3 --reuse_ish_calcs

You can find out more about the source code compile process by giving
the command:

  ./Install --help

Second, there may be hidden folders related to the version control system
called subversion which is used by the ESP-r development community. There
is no need for these hidden folders in a distribution. To clean these up go 
to /opt/esru and issue the following command:

  find . -name .svn -print >which_svn
  rm -rf `cat which_svn`

A similar process is taken for the GTK version.  You will need
the C header files and libraries related to GTK before you can
compile this version of ESP-r. Look in the document about setting
up OSX for ESP-r development for more information about this.

Either remove the /opt/esru/esp-r folder or at least
remove the executables from the /opt/esru/esp-r/bin folder.

Clear the source (via a make clean) and compile a new GTK 
version of esp-r.

  ./Install -d /opt/esru --gcc4 --compiler_version -4.3 --reuse_ish_calcs
 
Again remove the subversion files from the /opt/esru folders.


Creating the compressed tar files

Follow the instructions above to compile the X11 version of ESP-r to 
the /opt/esru folder structure. Be sure to remove the .svn folders as 
described above. Just to be certain, try running several of the new
ESP-r executables.  To ensure the correct path is included in the tar 
file create the tar file (alter the v11.10 to match the actual
version of ESP-r) via the following commands:

  cd /
  sudo tar cf esp-r_x11_v11.10_osx_intel_in_opt.tar opt/esru
  sudo gzip -9 esp-r_x11_v11.10_osx_intel_in_opt.tar

Now clean up the source distribution via a 'make clean' command. As the
example models and databases will be ok all you need to do is to remove
the executable files form /opt/esru/esp-r/bin and then recompile (but
say no to the databases and example models).

After compiling the GTK version create a compressed tar file for
this via the commands

  cd /
  sudo tar cf esp-r_gtk_v11.10_osx_intel_in_opt.tar opt/esru
  sudo gzip -9 esp-r_gtk_v11.10_osx_intel_in_opt.tar


Dependencies

ESP-r has a number of library dependencies depending for the X11 and 
GTK versions. If you have all of the libraries that you need then 
the various modules of the ESP-r suite will run. If not all of them 
exist then you will get an error message with the name of the library 
or libraries that have not been found. 

If you are running the X11 version of esp-r there are only a few libraries
that the executables will be looking for (the version numbers may 
be different on your machine):

otool -L ./clm
./clm:
        /usr/X11/lib/libX11.6.dylib (compatibility version 9.0.0, current version 9.0.0)
        /usr/local/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 7.10.0)
        /usr/lib/libxslt.1.dylib (compatibility version 3.0.0, current version 3.12.0)
        /usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib (compatibility version 9.0.0, current version 9.16.0)
        /usr/local/lib/libgfortran.3.dylib (compatibility version 4.0.0, current version 4.0.0)
        /usr/local/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 111.1.5)

These libraries will typically be installed with the X11 environment 
on Apple computers. X11 is an optional installer and is required to run ESP-r

if you are using the GTK version of ESP-r then there are rather a lot of
libraries that are required. Many of these tend to be located in a /sw folder
structure which is maintained by the 'fink' development packages. 
Instructions for using 'fink' are found in a different document.

% otool -L ./clm
./clm:
        /sw/lib/libgtk-x11-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 401.0.0, current version 401.9.0)
        /sw/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 401.0.0, current version 401.9.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libXrandr.2.dylib (compatibility version 2.0.0, current version 2.0.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libXinerama.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libXext.6.dylib (compatibility version 6.4.0, current version 6.4.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libXft.2.dylib (compatibility version 2.1.0, current version 2.1.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib (compatibility version 6.3.0, current version 6.3.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libXrender.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.2.0, current version 1.2.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libfontconfig.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.dylib (compatibility version 6.2.0, current version 6.2.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libXcursor.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /sw/lib/libatk-1.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 601.0.0, current version 601.1.0)
        /sw/lib/libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 401.0.0, current version 401.9.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 88.1.11)
        /sw/lib/libpangoxft-1.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 601.0.0, current version 601.0.0)
        /sw/lib/libpangox-1.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 601.0.0, current version 601.0.0)
        /sw/lib/libpango-1.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 601.0.0, current version 601.0.0)
        /sw/lib/libgobject-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 601.0.0, current version 601.6.0)
        /sw/lib/libgmodule-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 601.0.0, current version 601.6.0)
        /sw/lib/libglib-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 601.0.0, current version 601.6.0)
        /sw/lib/libintl.1.dylib (compatibility version 2.0.0, current version 2.1.0)
        /sw/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version 6.0.0, current version 6.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libmx.A.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 93.0.0)

The Intel version of ESP-r will not run on PPC computers. The gfortran run time
libraries (for Intel) may be needed. 

These need to be placed in /usr/local/lib if the machine does
not have the full GNU GCC compiler tool set.


Using/testing the compressed archive

There are two versions of ESP-r which can be installed. The
so-called X11 version is the legacy version and the GTK version
is an almost complete port of ESP-r using the GTK library. There
are a few functions which are not available in the GTK version
(e.g. click-on-bitmap).  The GTK version also has library
dependencies which are not required with the X11 version.

If you are using a pre-compiled archvie (as opposed to compiling
ESP-r) you are limited to installing only one of the
X11 or GTK version as they are installed to the same folder.

The extraction process will place an ESP-r distribution in the folders:

  /opt/esru/esp-r/
    bin
	climate
	databases
	manual
	training
	validation

The first step is to prepare a folder to install the ESP-r distribution. The
usual location is /opt/esru.  If you already have an /opt folder then skip
to `section two`. Because /opt is a protected folder it prevents normal users
from writing files in it and that ensures that the `corporate` databases ESP-r
uses cannot be casually modified. Installing an application in /opt requires
that you use the `sudo` command to preface your commands.

ESP-r requires an X11 environment to be installed on your OSX box. 
This is an optional set of packages which will be located on your 
operating system install DVD. If you see the X11 logo icon in your 
doc you probably have X11 installed. If you do not see it check in the 
Applications folder.  If it is not there then you need to install X11 from 
the DVD before proceeding.

There is some information you will need. Start up either a terminal or and X11 
window. Issue the following commands

  cd
  ls -l

You are looking for your user name and your group name. E.g.

drwxr-xr-x    60 jon  jon       2040 Jul 15 06:49 testing

the first jon is the user name and the second instance is the 
name of the group. In some cases the second instance might 
be staff or users.

To determine if it is necessary to create the /opt folder start
up either a terminal or and X11 terminal. In the terminal
give the following command:

  ls -l /

in the listing given look for the following line:

drwxr-xr-x    15 root  admin      510 Aug 31 12:38 opt

If you find this entry then there exists a /opt folder and
you should skip down to Section Two.

To create a new /opt folder give the following commands. Lets
assume that your login name is fred and your group is staff.

  cd /
  sudo mkdir opt
  sudo chmod a+x opt
  sudo chmod a+r opt
  cd /opt
  sudo mkdir esru
  sudo chown fred esru
  sudo chgrp staff esru
  sudo chmod a+x esru
  sudo chmod a+r esru
  sudo chmod u+w esru


Machines with an existing /opt folder

This section assumes that a /opt folder exists. As a standard
user you probably do not have permission to write new files and
folders in /opt so you will have to use the 'sudo' command.
The following commands create a folder /opt/esru

  cd /opt
  sudo mkdir esru
  sudo chown fred esru
  sudo chgrp staff esru
  sudo chmod a+x esru
  sudo chmod a+r esru
  sudo chmod u+w esru

Copy the the_file_name_tar.gz file (the_file_name represents 
the name of the file that you downloaded or was created in in 
the procedures above) to the / folder via the following commands 
(depending on which version of ESP-r you want:

 cd to_the_folder_with_the_tar.gz file
 sudo cp the_file_name.tar.gz /
 cd /
 sudo tar xfz the_file_name.tar.gz

This will create the ESP-r folder structure within /opt/esru
but it will be owned by the root user.  You now need to
alter the ownership of the /opt/esru folder structure.

Now lets make sure that everything in the folder /opt/esru
is available to be owned
  cd /opt/esru

  ls -l

And you should see
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   14 fred  staff  476 Aug 27 02:46 esp-r

If you see that the user is root and the user is admin
then we need to alter this via the following commands:

  cd /opt
  sudo chown -R fred esru
  sudo chgrp -R staff esru


Adapting your environment

You will need to set an environment variable PATH so that
the folder /opt/esru/esp-r/bin is known. Go back to your
home folder and see if there is a .cshrc or a .profile file.

  cd
  ls -al

Some users of ESP-r prefer to use the "C" shell. And the closest
thing on OSX is the tcsh interpreter (available within the fink
package management system). The entry in the .cshrc file in
your home folder might look something like:

set path = ( $path /usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin/ray /usr/local/lib/ray /Users/fred/bin \
/opt/esru/esp-r/bin /opt/esru/bin /sw/bin )

If you are running the bash shell then you would look for an entry
in the .profile file something like:

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/opt/esru/bin:/opt/esru/esp-r/bin:/Users/fred/bin:/sw/bin:$PATH

Once you have updated either the .cshrc file or the .profile file then you
will need to log out and then back in again.  To see if the environment
variables are correct give the following command:

  which prj
  which bps

If the answer back is '/opt/esru/esp-r/bin/prj' then the environment variable
is set.  Most users will want to run ESP-r in graphics mode so you need to
give the command to start esp-r from within and X11 command window rather
than the OSX terminal (which only handles text based applications).
If the application does start up then the environment variables have been set
correctly.  

If you are working with existing models you should change the
folder focus in the X11 terminal to the model configuration folder
and start the project manager with the pattern:

  prj -model my_model.cfg

Once ESP-r is working you can remove the_file_name.tar.gz


Where to get more information

The ESP-r download pages have separate folders for each operating 
system. Further information is available on issues related to setup 
of an OSX machine to work with ESP-r.
