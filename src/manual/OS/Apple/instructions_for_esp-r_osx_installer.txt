        Steps to create or use the ESP-r self extractor on OSX

There are two patterns used to create an installer for ESP-r for use
on OSX machines.  One is via a single-file self extractor and the
second is to use compressed archive files.  Both of these will be
covered in this document.

If you want to use the self-extractor or compressed archive file
please skip down to the relevant section.


Building a self-extractor

The self-extractor for ESP-r on a Mac is based on a package called 
makeself-2.1.4 (which also works on Linux and in the Cygwin environment
of Windows PCs). Makeself is a script which can be downloaded from
<XX>  and it allows a pre-compiled version of ESP-r to be extracted on
a users computer with minimal interaction.

First compile a standard version of esp-r (X11 version) in the standard
location which on OSX should be /opt/esru with a command such as:

  ./Install -d /opt/esru --compiler_version -3.4
  or
  ./Install -d /opt/esru --compiler_version -4.3

You can find out more about the source code compile process by giving
the command:

  ./Install --help

Second, there may be hidden folders related to the version control system
called subversion which is used by the ESP-r development community. There
is no need for these hidden folders in /opt/esru. To clean these up go 
to /opt/esru and issue the following command:

  find . -name .svn -print >which_svn
  rm -rf `cat which_svn`

Create a folder /opt/precompiled_for_osx

  sudo mkdir /opt/precompiled_for_osx

Then create a tar file of the esp-r folders (the example below 
includes a version in the name of the tar file which you may
wish to change to reflect the current version number).

 cd /
 sudo tar cf esp-r_X11_11.6_osx.tar /opt/esru/esp-r

gzip -9 that tar file and move it into /opt/precompiled_for_osx.

A similar process is taken for the GTK version.  You will need
the C header files and libraries related to GTK before you can
compile this version of ESP-r. Look in the document about setting
up OSX for ESP-r development for more information about this.

Either remove the /opt/esru/esp-r folder or at least
remove the executables from the /opt/esru/esp-r/bin folder.

Clear the source (via a make clean) and compile a new GTK 
version of esp-r.
  ./Install -d /opt/esru --compiler_version -3.4
  or
  ./Install -d /opt/esru --gcc4 --compiler_version -4.3
 
Again remove the subversion files from the /opt/esru folders.

Create the tar file of the GTK distribution and gzip it and
place it in the precompiled_for_osx folder (as above). 

Remember to remove any older *.tar.gz files from the precompiled_for_osx
folder so that are not included in the installer run file.

Next, Edit the setup script (setup_osx) to include the specific names 
of the gzipped tar files.

In folder /opt/precompiled_for_osx along with the gziped tar files
there are several other files as follows:

License (text which is used to advise the user on license conditions).
setup_osx (a script which tells makeself.sh what to do during the 
extraction process.

The file that does most of the work is setup_osx.  This needs to be edited
slightly to include the specific ...tar.gz files.  The other
files are helper applications that setup_osx is going to copy.

The way that the self extractor is created is via a command similar
to the one below (adapt for your makeself.sh location and for the
machine type PPC/Intel):

For PPC
sudo /Users/jon/bin/makeself-2.1.5/makeself.sh pre_compiled_for_osx esp-r_v11.6_osx_precomp.run "ESP-r V11.6 distribution PPC for OSX (/opt/esru)" ./setup_osx

For Intel
sudo /Users/jon/bin/makeself-2.1.5/makeself.sh pre_compiled_for_osx esp-r_v11.6_osx_precomp_intel.run "ESP-r V11.6 distribution Intel for OSX (/opt/esru)" ./setup

The tokens in the above command are as follows:

makeself.sh is a general script that creates installers. makeself-2.1.4 can be
downloaded from the web and it will create its own executables.  The command includes
the full path to where makeself.sh is located on your machine. 

The 2nd token is the name of the folder where the files to be installed are 
located (as noted in the first step). 

The 3rd token is the name of the 'run' file that is going to be created (a run 
file is the finished esp-r installer that will be placed on the web). 

The 4th token is a quoted string which is the message that will be printed out when
the installer runs. 

The 5th token ./setup_osx is the edited setup script within the precompiled_GTK_for_cygwin
folder. This script needs to have a chmod a+x done on it.

It is A REALLY GOOD IDEA to test use of the self-extractor on a clean machine.


Dependencies

ESP-r has a number of library dependencies depending for the X11 and GTK versions.
If you have all of the libraries that you need then the various modules
of the ESP-r suite will run. If not all of them exist then you will get
an error message with the name of the library or libraries that have
not been found. 

If you are running the X11 version of esp-r there are only a few libraries
that the executables will be looking for (the version numbers may be different
on your machine):

 otool -L ./clm
./clm:
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.dylib (compatibility version 6.2.0, current version 6.2.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 88.1.11)
        /usr/lib/libmx.A.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 93.0.0)

These libraries will typically be installed with the X11 environment on Apple computers.
X11 is an optional installer and is required to run ESP-r

if you are using the GTK version of ESP-r then there are rather a lot of
libraries that are required. Many of these tend to be located in a /sw folder
structure which is maintained by the 'fink' development packages.  Instructions
for using 'fink' are found in a different document.

% otool -L ./clm
./clm:
        /sw/lib/libgtk-x11-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 401.0.0, current version 401.9.0)
        /sw/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 401.0.0, current version 401.9.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libXrandr.2.dylib (compatibility version 2.0.0, current version 2.0.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libXinerama.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libXext.6.dylib (compatibility version 6.4.0, current version 6.4.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libXft.2.dylib (compatibility version 2.1.0, current version 2.1.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib (compatibility version 6.3.0, current version 6.3.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libXrender.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.2.0, current version 1.2.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libfontconfig.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.dylib (compatibility version 6.2.0, current version 6.2.0)
        /usr/X11R6/lib/libXcursor.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
        /sw/lib/libatk-1.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 601.0.0, current version 601.1.0)
        /sw/lib/libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 401.0.0, current version 401.9.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 88.1.11)
        /sw/lib/libpangoxft-1.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 601.0.0, current version 601.0.0)
        /sw/lib/libpangox-1.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 601.0.0, current version 601.0.0)
        /sw/lib/libpango-1.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 601.0.0, current version 601.0.0)
        /sw/lib/libgobject-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 601.0.0, current version 601.6.0)
        /sw/lib/libgmodule-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 601.0.0, current version 601.6.0)
        /sw/lib/libglib-2.0.0.dylib (compatibility version 601.0.0, current version 601.6.0)
        /sw/lib/libintl.1.dylib (compatibility version 2.0.0, current version 2.1.0)
        /sw/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version 6.0.0, current version 6.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libmx.A.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 93.0.0)

The PPC version of ESP-r will usually run on Intel machines in emulation. Testing has indicated
that Intel compiled versions may require the gfortran run time libraries libgfortran.3.dylib, 
libgfortran.a and libgfortran.la.  These need to be placed in /usr/local/lib if the machine does
not have the full GNU GCC compiler tool set.


Using/testing the self-extractor


If you have just created an installer you should test this on a separate
machine to confirm that it works.  If you have downloaded the 
self-extractor `run` file it can be used via either the OSX terminal (which
supports text interactions) or within an OSX X11 graphics terminal.

Typically the `run` file you downloaded should be placed in /opt and run 
via a sudo command from that folder via a command (adapt to reflect the 
actual name of the `run` file).
 
  sudo ./esp-r_v11.6_osx_precomp.run

On most OSX machines a file ending in .run will be treated as an executable. 
If the installer does not execute you may have to issue the following command 
to change its permissions:

  sudo chmod a+x ./esp-r_v11.6_osx_precomp.run

There are two versions of ESP-r which can be installed. The
so-called X11 version is the legacy version and the GTK version
is an almost complete port of ESP-r using the GTK libary. There
are a few functions which are not available in the GTK version
so this is generally viewed as BETA software.  The GTK version also
has a number of library dependencies which are not required of
the X11 version. If you are using the self-extractor (as opposed
to compiling ESP-r) you are limited to installing either the
X11 or GTK version as they are installed to the same folder.

The installer will ask you a number of yes/no questions and, if
successful it will place an ESP-r distribution in the folders:

  /opt/esru/esp-r/
    bin
	climate
	databases
	manual
	training
	validation

and it will create a link from /usr/esru to /opt/esru

During the install process LOOK FOR DIRECTIONS for
adapting your PATH environment variable (if required).
Once you have checked that ESP-r modules run you can
remove the installer.


Adapting your environment

You will need to set an environment variable PATH so that
the folder /opt/esru/esp-r/bin is known. Go back to your
home folder and see if there is a .cshrc or a .profile file.

  cd
  ls -al

Some users of ESP-r prefer to use the "C" shell. And the closest
thing on OSX is the tcsh interpreter (available within the fink
package management system). The entry in the .cshrc file in
your home folder might look something like:

set path = ( $path /usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin/ray /usr/local/lib/ray /Users/fred/bin \
/opt/esru/esp-r/bin /opt/esru/bin /sw/bin )

If you are running the bash shell then you would look for an entry
in the .profile file something like:

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/opt/esru/bin:/opt/esru/esp-r/bin:/Users/fred/bin:/sw/bin:$PATH

Once you have updated either the .cshrc file or the .profile file then you
will need to log out and then back in again.  To see if the environment
variables are correct give the following command:

  which prj

If the answer back is '/opt/esru/esp-r/bin/prj' then the environment variable
is set.  Most users will want to run ESP-r in graphics mode so you need to
give the command to start esp-r from within and X11 command window rather
than the OSX terminal (which only handles text based applications).


Where to get more information

The ESP-r download pages have separate folders for each operating system. Further
information is available on issues related to setup of an OSX machine to work
with ESP-r.


Installing via compressed archive files

As an alternative, some Apple machines do not work well with self-extractor. In this
case the gzipped tar files can be used to install ESP-r. The following is a list of
steps that users should take in order to install via a tar file.

The first step is to prepare a folder to install the ESP-r distribution. The
usual location is /opt/esru.  If you already have an /opt folder then skip
to `section two`. Because /opt is a protected folder it prevents normal users
from writing files in it and that ensures that the `corporate` databases ESP-r
uses cannot be casually modified. Installing an application in /opt requires
that you use the `sudo` command to preface your commands.

ESP-r requires an X11 environment to be installed on your OSX box. This is an 
optional set of packages which will be located on your operating system install 
DVD. If you see the X11 logo icon in your doc you probably have X11 installed. If
you do not see it check in the Applications folder.  If it is not there then
you need to install X11 from the DVD before proceeding.

There is some information you will need. Start up either a terminal or and X11 
window. Issue the following commands

  cd
  ls -l

You are looking for your user name and your group name. E.g.

drwxr-xr-x    60 jon  jon       2040 Jul 15 06:49 testing

the first jon is the user name and the second instance is the name of the 
group. In some cases the second instance might be staff or users.

There are two version of ESP-r for OSX. One is based on the X11 graphics 
library and is a complete version of ESP-r but is an older style of 
interaction. The other version of ESP-r uses the GTK graphics library 
with a modern style of interaction (but it is not quite a complete port
of ESP-r). The web page gives more information on the specific differences.

To determine if it is necessary to create the /opt folder start
up either a terminal or and X11 terminal. In the terminal
give the following command:

  ls -l /

in the listing given look for the following line:

drwxr-xr-x    15 root  admin      510 Aug 31 12:38 opt

If you find this entry then there exists a /opt folder and
you should skip down to Section Two.

To create a new /opt folder give the following commands. Lets
assume that your login name is fred and your group is staff.

  cd /
  sudo mkdir opt
  sudo chmod a+x opt
  sudo chmod a+r opt
  cd /opt
  sudo mkdir esru
  sudo chown fred esru
  sudo chgrp staff esru
  sudo chmod a+x esru
  sudo chmod a+r esru
  sudo chmod u+w esru


Section two

This section assumes that a /opt folder exists. As a standard
user you probably do not have permission to write new files and
folders in /opt so you will have to use the 'sudo' command.
The following commands create a folder /opt/esru

  cd /opt
  sudo mkdir esru
  sudo chown fred esru
  sudo chgrp staff esru
  sudo chmod a+x esru
  sudo chmod a+r esru
  sudo chmod u+w esru

Copy the the_file_name_tar.gz file (the_file_name represents the name of the file
that you downloaded or was created in in the procedures above) to the /opt folder
via the following commands (depending on which version of
ESP-r you want:

 cd to_the_folder_with_the_tar.gz file
 sudo cp the_file_name.tar.gz /opt

Next, go back to /opt and uncompress the tar.gz file for the version
of ESP-r that you want to create.

  cd /opt

  sudo gzip -d the_file_name.tar.gz
  sudo chown fred the_file_name.tar
  sudo chgrp staff the_file_name.tar

Since the folder /opt/esru is alreay owned by fred it should
be possible to extract from the tar file the ESP-r distribution
via the command:

  tar xf the_file_name.tar

Now lets make sure that everything in the folder /opt/esru
is available to be owned
  cd /opt/esru

  ls -l

And you should see
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   14 fred  staff  476 Aug 27 02:46 esp-r

If you see that the user is root and the user is admin
then we need to alter this via the following commands:

  cd /opt
  sudo chown -R fred esru
  sudo chgrp -R staff esru

You will need to set an environment variable PATH as explained above.

Once ESP-r is working you can remove the_file_name.tar
