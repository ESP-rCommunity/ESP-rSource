        Steps to create or use the ESP-r self extractor on Cygwin
                            March 2009

There are two patterns used to create an installer for ESP-r for use
on Cygwin emulators within Windows computers.  One is via a single-file 
self extractor and the second is to use compressed archive files.  
Both of these will be covered in this document.

If you want to use the self-extractor or compressed archive file
please skip down to the relevant section.


Building a self-extractor

The self-extractor for ESP-r is based on a package called 
makeself-2.1.5. Makeself is a script which can be downloaded from
<XX>  and it allows a pre-compiled version of ESP-r to be extracted on
a users computer with minimal interaction.

The commands to compile a standard version of esp-r (X11 version) 
in the standard location which on cygwin should be /usr/esru with 
a command such as:

  ./Install -d /usr/esru --gcc3 --compiler_version -3.4
  or
  ./Install -d /usr/esru --gcc4 --compiler_version -4.1

You can find out more about the source code compile process by giving
the command:

  ./Install --help

Before compiling check that /usr/esru exists and that you can write
to it.  If it does not exist issue the command

  mkdir /usr/esru

After you have built the ESP-r distribution in /usr/esru, there may be 
hidden folders related to the version control system called
subversion which is used by the ESP-r development community. There
is no need for these hidden folders in /usr/esru. To clean these up go 
to /usr/esru and issue the following command:

  find . -name .svn -print >which_svn
  rm -rf `cat which_svn`

Create a folder /usr/esru/precompiled_for_cygwin

  mkdir /usr/esru/precompiled_for_cygwin

Then create a tar file of the esp-r folders (the example below 
includes a version in the name of the tar file which you may
wish to change to reflect the current version number).

  tar cf esp-r_X11_11.7_cygwin.tar esp-r
  gzip -9 esp-r_X11_11.7_cygwin.tar
  mv esp-r_X11_11.7_cygwin.tar.gz /usr/esru/precompiled_for_cygwin

A similar process is taken for the GTK version.  You will need
the C header files and libraries related to GTK before you can
compile this version of ESP-r. Look in the document about setting
up cygwin for ESP-r development for more information about this.

To compile a GTK version either remove the /usr/esru/esp-r folder
or at least remove the executables from the /usr/esru/esp-r/bin folder.

Clear the source (via a make clean) and compile a new GTK 
version of esp-r.
  ./Install -d /usr/esru --gcc3 --compiler_version -3.4
  or
  ./Install -d /usr/esru --gcc4 --compiler_version -4.1
 
Again remove the subversion files from the /usr/esru folders.

Create the tar file of the GTK distribution and gzip it and
place it in the precompiled_for_cygwin folder (as above). 

  tar cf esp-r_GTK_11.7_cygwin.tar esp-r
  gzip -9 esp-r_GTK_11.7_cygwin.tar
  mv esp-r_GTK_11.7_cygwin.tar.gz /usr/esru/precompiled_for_cygwin

Remember to remove any older *.tar.gz files from the precompiled_for_cygwin
folder so that are not included in the installer run file.

Next, Edit the setup script (setup) to include the specific names 
of the gzipped tar files.  After editing ensure that the setup
has execute permissions  e.g.  chmod a+x setup

In folder /usr/esru/precompiled_for_cygwin along with the gziped tar files
there are several other files as follows:

License (text which is used to advise the user on license conditions).
setup (a script which tells makeself.sh what to do during the extraction
      process.

The file that does most of the work is setup.  This needs to be edited
slightly to include the specific ...tar.gz files.  The other
files are helper applications that setup is going to copy.

The way that the self extractor is created is via a command similar
to the one below (adapt for your makeself.sh location):

sudo /home/jon/bin/makeself-2.1.5/makeself.sh precompiled_for_cygwin esp-r_v11.7_cygwin_precomp.run "ESP-r V11.7 distribution" ./setup

The tokens in the above command are as follows:

makeself.sh is a general script that creates installers. makeself-2.1.5 can be
downloaded from the web and it will create its own executables.  The command includes
the full path to where makeself.sh is located on your machine. 

The 2nd token is the name of the folder where the files to be installed are 
located (as noted in the first step). 

The 3rd token is the name of the 'run' file that is going to be created (a run 
file is the finished esp-r installer that will be placed on the web). 

The 4th token is a quoted string which is the message that will be printed out when
the installer runs. 

The 5th token ./setup is the edited setup script within the precompiled_for_cygwin
folder. This script needs to have a chmod a+x done on it.

It is A REALLY GOOD IDEA to test use of the self-extractor on a clean machine.

ESP-r has a number of library dependencies depending for the X11 and GTK versions.
If you have all of the libraries that you need then the various modules
of the ESP-r suite will run. If not all of them exist then you will get
an error message with the name of the library or libraries that have
not been found. The instructions for setting up cygwin include the libraries
that you will need.

If you are running the X11 version of esp-r there are only a few libraries
that the executables will be looking for (libX11.a libm.a). If you are using 
the GTK version of ESP-r then there are rather a lot of libraries that are 
required.


Using/testing the self-extractor

If you have just created an installer you should test this on a separate
machine to confirm that it works.  If you have downloaded the 
self-extractor `run` file it can be used via either the text-only
initial Cygwin terminal or within an X11 graphics terminal typically
started via the startxwin.sh command.


Typically the `run` file you downloaded should be placed in /tmp within
the cygwin environment and run from that folder via a command (adapt to reflect the 
actual name of the `run` file).  For example:

  ./esp-r_v11.7_cygwin_precomp.run

If nothing happens it may be that the download process has removed the
execute permissions from the run file.  You can re-enable these via
the command:

  chmod a+x ./esp-r_v11.7_cygwin_precomp.run

There are two versions of ESP-r which can be installed. The
so-called X11 version is the legacy version and the GTK version
is an almost complete port of ESP-r using the GTK libary. There
are a few functions which are not available in the GTK version
so this is generally viewed as BETA software.  The GTK version also
has a number of library dependencies which are not required of
the X11 version. If you are using the self-extractor (as opposed
to compiling ESP-r) you are limited to installing either the
X11 or GTK version as they are installed to the same folder.

The installer will ask you a number of yes/no questions and, if
successful it will place an ESP-r distribution in the folders:

  /usr/esru/esp-r/
    bin
	climate
	databases
	manual
	training
	validation

During the install process LOOK FOR DIRECTIONS for
adapting your PATH environment variable (if required).
Once you have checked that ESP-r modules run you can
remove the installer.
Adapting your environment

You will need to set an environment variable PATH so that
the folder /usr/esru/esp-r/bin is known. Go back to your
home folder and see if there is a .cshrc or a .profile file.

  cd
  ls -al

Some users of ESP-r prefer to use the "C" shell. The entry 
in the .cshrc file in your home folder might look something like:

set path = ( $path /usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin/ray /usr/local/lib/ray /home/fred/bin \
/usr/esru/esp-r/bin )

If you are running the bash shell then you would look for an entry
in the .profile file something like:

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/esru/bin:/usr/esru/esp-r/bin:/home/fred/bin:$PATH

Once you have updated either the .cshrc file or the .profile file then you
will need to log out and then back in again.  To see if the environment
variables are correct give the following command:

  which prj

If the answer back is '/usr/esru/esp-r/bin/prj' then the environment variable
is set.  Most users will want to run ESP-r in graphics mode so you need to
give the command to start esp-r from within and X11 command window rather
than the initial cygwin terminal (which only handles text based applications).


Where to get more information

The ESP-r download pages have separate folders for each operating system. Further
information is available on issues related to setup cygwin to work
with ESP-r.


Installing via compressed archive files

As an alternative, some machines do not work well with self-extractor. In this
case the gzipped tar files can be used to install ESP-r. The following is a list of
steps that users should take in order to install via a tar file.

The first step is to prepare a folder to install the ESP-r distribution. The
usual location is /usr/esru.

ESP-r requires an X11 environment to be installed. This is an optional
set of packages which will be included if you follow the instructions
for setting up cygwin. If it is not there then you need to install X11 from
the cygwin setup.exe application (in Windows) before proceeding.

There is some information you will need. Start up either a terminal or and X11 
window. Issue the following commands

  cd
  ls -l

You are looking for your user name and your group name. E.g.

drwxr-xr-x    60 jon  jon       2040 Jul 15 06:49 testing

the first jon is the user name and the second instance is the name of the 
group. In some cases the second instance might be staff or users.

There are two version of ESP-r for cygwin. One is based on the X11 graphics 
library and is a complete version of ESP-r but is an older style of 
interaction. The other version of ESP-r uses the GTK graphics library 
with a modern style of interaction (but it is not quite a complete port
of ESP-r). The web page gives more information on the specific differences.

To determine if it is necessary to create the /usr/esru folder start
up either a terminal or and X11 terminal. In the terminal
give the following command:

  ls -l /usr

in the listing given look for the following line:

drwxr-xr-x    15 root  admin      510 Aug 31 12:38 esru

To create a new /usr/esru folder give the following commands. Lets
assume that your login name is fred and your group is staff.

  cd /usr
  mkdir esru
  chmod a+x esru
  chmod a+r esru
  chmod u+w esru

Copy the the_file_name_tar.gz file (the_file_name represents the name of the file
that you downloaded or was created in in the procedures above) to the /usr folder
via the following commands (depending on which version of
ESP-r you want:

 cd to_the_folder_with_the_tar.gz file
 cp the_file_name.tar.gz /usr/esru

Next, go back to /usr and uncompress the tar.gz file for the version
of ESP-r that you want to create.

  cd /usr/esru

  gzip -d the_file_name.tar.gz
  chown fred the_file_name.tar
  chgrp staff the_file_name.tar

Since the folder /usr/esru is alreay owned by fred it should
be possible to extract from the tar file the ESP-r distribution
via the command:

  tar xf the_file_name.tar

Now lets make sure that everything in the folder /usr/esru
is available to be owned
  cd /usr/esru

  ls -l

And you should see
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   14 fred  staff  476 Aug 27 02:46 esp-r

If you see that the user is root and the user is admin
then we need to alter this via the following commands:

  cd /usr/esru
  chown -R fred esp-r
  chgrp -R staff esp-r

You will need to set an environment variable PATH as explained above.

Once ESP-r is working you can remove the_file_name.tar
