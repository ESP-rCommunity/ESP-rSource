                 May 2009 version
 
 1.0 Introduction:
 
 Using ESP-r on a PC requires a compatible operating environment.
 There is, for example a Native Windows version of ESP-r, however
 some production tasks and development tasks are more robust under
 the Cygwin emulation environment on Windows computers. Cygwin 
 provides the necessary display, command shell, and low-level 
 library functions and system calls which ESP-r expects to find
 on a Linux computer, but integrated within the Windows environment.
 
 Cygwin differs from virtualization in that it exists within the
 same folder structure of Windows rather than in a virtual computer
 so it naturally sees the Windows file folders and Windows Explorer
 can access the files within the Cygwin environment.  Cygwin allows
 ESP-r to run at almost the same speed as a native version.
 
 The document also discusses how to install ESP-r once Cygwin
 has been setup. There are two options: install from a 
 precompiled distribution downloaded from the
 University of Strathclyde ftp server, or install from
 source. 
 
 Setting up cygwin requires several steps and the use of commands 
 which will be familiar to those who have used Unix/Linux. If you
 want to jump into that jungle and get your fingers bitten off
 then you will  not  want to read the sections that follow. You
 would probably also want to skip the information on the Cygwin
 web site at <http://www.cygwin.com>.
 
 1.1 Before you download and install cygwin:
 
 Prior to downloading and installing cygwin ensure there is an
 administrative and at least one normal user on your PC. Typically
 the Administrator user would maintains the cygwin and ESP-r
 applications. If you work as a different user for normal simulation
 tasks then it is harder to corrupt databases and test models.
 
 Hints: ESP-r works much better if user names do not have spaces or 
 unprintable characters. ESP-r also works better if you setup your
 user account to have a home folder like C:\Joe rather than the
 typical C:\Documents and Settings\Joe. 
 
 If the computer is part of a domain then there are additional commands needed
 to create entries in the /etc/passwd file and the /etc/group file.
 
 If you are going to take the entire cygwin environment you
 will need ~2.5GB of disk space. If you restrict
 cygwin to packages needed to develop ESP-r then you will need
 ~1.6GB of disk space. If you take a minimum
 cygwin that is sufficient to run ESP-r then you will need
 ~1GB of free space for cygwin. You will need ~400 MB
 for ESP-r and Radiance.
 
 The install process tends to present fewer hassles if you
 do the Cygwin install as administrator.
 
 1.2 Installing cygwin from the web:
 
 Point a web browser at <http://www.cygwin.com> and click on the "install
 cygwin" icon. This will download a small setup.exe application (c:\TEMP
 is a good place to put it) which will be used to download and install
 cygwin components. This same tool can also be used to update cygwin.
 
 Once downloaded run the setup.exe and it will ask the following
 questions:
   a) Where to get cygwin? Choose the option "internet" if this if
      you have a fast connection and will be installing cygwin on
      one machine. Choose the "download" option if you want to install
      cygwin on more than one machine. Choose the "Install from local
      directory" if you have already downloaded a cygwin distribution
      or are doing it from a CD.
 
   b) Where to put it? Take the suggestion c:\cygwin and also
      the default option "all users" and "Unix file type".
      When asked about a "local package directory accept
      "c:\TEMP" if internet or download, or point to a folder
      with previously downloaded files if that is the approach
      you are taking.
  
   c) For an internet or download install you may have to set an
      appropriate proxy (In the University of Strathclyde this is:
      www-cache.strath.ac.uk port 8080)
 
   d) Select a download site. 
 
 Once the ftp site has been reached the next task is to 
 select the packages to install. There are essentially
 three levels depending on how much disk space you want
 to allocate to cygwin and ESP-r. If disk space is not
 a problem follow the instructions in section 1.3a.
 If you want cygwin to support compilation of ESP-r
 the skip section 1.3b. If you just want to run ESP-r 
 skip to the section 1.3c.
 
 Consider what type of window manager you would like to
 use.  It is possible to replicate the GNOME or KDE
 window managers found on Linux computers if you have
 lots of disk space and a fast computer. There is 
 also a minimal approach that allows for ESP-r to run
 in graphic mode without a window manager e.g. it just
 pops-up on the normal screen as an application.
 
 1.3a If disk space is not a problem -  
 
 Select all by toggling the "All -> default" to "All -> Install". This
 could take a few moments for this change to take affect.  It
 can take 30 minutes to download All and another 30 minutes to
 install.
 
 1.3b Packages for ESP-r development - 
 
 If you want to be selective and only download what is required
 to compile and run ESP-r (and save download time and disk space)
 the following is a useful guide:
 
  Admin:        tick all (i.e. toggle Install)
  Archive:      tick all
  Base:         tick all
  Audio:        optional
  Database:     optional
  Devel:        if you have space toggle to Install
  
                if you want to save some space toggle to Install and then
		go into the list and remove the Qt development files along
		with Ada compiler and Pascal compiler
		
		you will want both the gcc3.4/g77 as well as the
		version 4 gcc g++ with gfortran
		
  Doc:          optional but at least get the man pages and xpdf
  Editors:      at least nedit, vim & midnight commander
  Games:        optional
  Gnome:        optional if all you want is an X11 version of ESP-r
                otherwise - add the runtime and development versions of
		atk, gdk-pixbuf, glib2, gtk2-x11-engines, libgnome2,
		libxslt, libxml2, pango
		 
  Graphics:     tick ImageMagic, ghostscript, jpeg, libpng,
                opengl,tiff and image libraries
  KDE:          optional
  Intepretors:  tick expect, gawk, m4, perl 
  Libs:         tick all except guile and tetext
  Mail:         optional
  Math:         optional
  Net:          tick openssh, ping, inetutils, rsync.
  Perl:         leave at default
  Publishing:   optional + psutils
  Shells:       pick all
  System:       pick procps, 
  Text:         pick enscript, groff, gv,less, more, textinfo
  Utils:        pick bzip2, clear, cygutils, file, gnupg, keychain,
                ncurses, patch, time, units
  Web:          optional + wget, cadaver, neon
  X11:          typically toggle to Install and then try removing most
                of the 100dpi fonts and the Qt items and Windowmaker
		
                for a minimal X11 install use default + least one window 
		manager (fvfwm is a minimal one) plus everything that 
		starts with xorg and then add Xaw3D, grace, lesstif,
	        transfig and xfig.
 
 1.3c Packages needed just to run ESP-r:
 
 If you want to be selective and only download what is required
 to RUN ESP-r (and save even more download time and disk space)
 the following is a useful guide:
 
  Admin:        tick all
  Archive:      tick all
  Base:         toggle to default
  Database:     toggle to default
  Devel:        toggle to default
  Doc:          toggle to default + xpdf
  Editors:      at least nedit, vim & midnight commander
  Games:        optional
  Gnome:        optional
  Graphics:     toggle to default and add ImageMagic
  Intepretors:  toggle to default plus gawk and expect 
  Libs:    toggle to default
  Mail:         toggle to none
  Math:         toggle to default
  Net:          toggle to default
  Publishing:   toggle to default
  Shells:       pick all
  System:       pick procps, 
  Text:         pick enscript, less, more, textinfo
  Utils:        toggle to default
  Web:          toggle to default plus wget
  X11:          use the minimal install list from above.
 
 
 1.4 Post-install patches:
                 
 After completing the list the installer will download the various
 packages and put an icon on the desktop. The installer takes some time 
 sorting out the post-install so do not give up!
 
 Once Cygwin is installed you can move on to the 2nd stage of 
 installing ESP-r and Radiance.
 
 After login into the PC as Administrator (suggested), click on the Cygwin 
 icon on your desktop to start up a cygwin window. This emulates a Linux
 machine within your PC. Use Linux commands to go to
 the /tmp folder or create such a folder if it does not
 exist.
 
 The first time you log in as each user, Cygwin will
 create some `dot` (environment settings) files in your
 home folder. If you log in as Ralph you should be located 
 in /home/Ralph after you log in.
 
 Pick either section 1.5a, 1.5b, 1.5c depending on where you
 got the ESP-r distribution.
 
 1.5 Installing ESP-r by downloading a precompiled version
 
 If downloading from the ftp site <ftp://ftp.strath.ac.uk> as
 user anonymous and with your email address as the password. Go
 to Esru_public and look for the Cygwin folder. Download the
 file ending in .run as well as any readme files to the
 /tmp folder of Cygwin.

 Read the readme file(s) and then (typically as Administrator) 
 run the installer script(the file ends with .run). This will 
 guide you through the rest of the install process.  No compilation 
 is necessary because a complete executable distribution for ESP-r
 and Radiance is included.
 
 When the script is complete, go to section 1.7.
   
 1.6 Compile instructions:
 
 Once Cygwin is installed you need to alter several files so that
 cygwin starts with an appropriate PATH environment variable. This
 process is similar to that for installing from a precompiled version
 but without using the self-extracting installer.
  
 Standard cygwin will install a gfortran compiler in /usr/bin/
 If you issue the command which gfortran you should get /usr/bin/gfortran.exe
 and /usr/bin/gfortran-4.exe.  You will also need matching gcc
 and g++ compilers.  If these may be listed as g++-4.exe and gcc-4.exe.
 If this is the case then your subsequent use of the ESP-r Install
 script will need to include the directive --compiler_version -4
 in order to ensure that all of the compilers are found.
 
 Issue the command "logout" or "exit" in the Cygwin command
 window and then click on the cygwin icon on the desktop
 to re-establish the PATH environment variable and get an initial
 cygwin command shell window. 
 
 Create a source folder for the esp-r distribution. A typical
 location would be <home_folder>/src/esp-r ESP-r source code is
 now available via a subversion server (source code control). 

 Instructions for its use can be found on the ESP-r web page
 <http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk>
 Unless you are part of the ESP-r development team you will probably
 want to use the 'export' command rather than 'checkout'.

 Once you have the source code have a look at the Readme file. 
 There is an install script which can be invoked via the command

   ./Install -d /usr/esru --gcc4

 and if you want to find out what the install options are

   ./Install -h
 
 
 Install, when run, will have an option for a compile under the
 Cygwin environment. The compile process should proceed much
 as it does under Solaris or Linux or OS X. You will be asked
 if you want to install training files [say yes] and databases
 [say yes].

 
 1.7 After ESP-r install:
 
 Typically users will start up an X display desktop and work within
 that. There are two general types of X display desktop. The first
 approach creates begins with the initial cygwin text console in which
 the command  startxwin.sh or startxwin.bat are run to start up a
 graphic (X11) terminal from which graphic applications such as ESP-r
 can be run.  

 Even though you may have to be Administrator to use the single file
 installer, if you start up a graphic terminal as Administrator you
 may find that subsequent logins as other users may not work because
 of some hidden lock files in /tmp/.X11 or because the X11 log file
 in /var/log cannot be written. If this happens try removing either
 of these files (as Administrator).

 It may also be possible to run Cygwin in a virtual screen. See the
 Cygwin documentation for setting this up. It typically requires that
 you have installed some form of window manager (the most basic is twm).
 
 
 1.8 Radiance install:
 
 The precompiled ESP-r distributions include a precompiled
 Radiance version 3.5 as part of the normal install process.
 
 It is also possible to compile Radiance in the cygwin 
 environment. Note that the tiff related modules tend not to 
 compile, but none of these is essential for use with ESP-r. 
 Out-of-the-box (e.g. a fresh download of the standard
 Radiance distribution will mostly likely fail in several 
 places). You will have to manually copy quite a few of the 
 executables and shell scripts to their proper location and
 for this reason we recommend using the precompiled version
 from the ESRU download site.
