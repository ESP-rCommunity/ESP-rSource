November 2007 version of notes

Do a typcial default install within the src folder
that has been export from the svn repository (use export
to avoid all of the .svn folders)  Say no to the XML
output (unless doing this for a special reason or on
a computer you know has all of the xml support libraries).

./Install --debug

To remove the .svn (hidden) folders from the compiled
file folders go to /usr/esru/esp-r and issue the following
two commands:
  find . -name .svn -print > which_svn
  
  rm -rf `cat which_svn`

After building X11 version create a tar file:
tar cf esp-r_v11.4_X11_cygwin.tar bin docs esp-r lib tutorial

then gzip the file and move it into precompiled_for_cygwin folder.
gzip -9 esp-r_v11.4_X11_cygwin.tar
mv esp-r_v11.4_X11_cygwin.tar.gz precompiled_for_cygwin

suggest doing a cleanup of the executables and object files before
building the GTK version.  If you want to back up the esp-r
main distribution folder then
mv /home/esru/esp-r /home/esru/esp-r_X11

After building GTK version and removing the .svn folders the
following commands will create the tar file:
tar cf esp-r_v11.4_GTK_cygwin.tar bin docs esp-r lib tutorial

then gzip the file and also move it into precompiled_for_cygwin folder.
gzip -9 esp-r_v11.4_GTK_cygwin.tar
mv esp-r_v11.4_GTK_cygwin.tar.gz precompiled_for_cygwin

Remember to remove any older *.tar.gz files from the precompiled_for_cygwin
folder so that are not included in the installer run file.

the next line creates combined installer (user is asked which version to extract).
/home/esru/src/makeself-2.1.4/makeself.sh precompiled_for_cygwin
esp-r_v11.4_cygwin_precomp.run "ESP-r V11.4 distribution for cygwin (standard install location)" ./setup
