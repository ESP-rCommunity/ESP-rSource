 be set.\n

 Once you have completed the install logout and then\n
 login as a normal user and start a graphic command\n
 window (you can do this via startxwin.sh or startxwin.bat.\n
 And in that command window issue the command 'prj'\n
 (without the quotes). If the installation was successful\n
 you should find that the Project Manager application\n
 has started up. If it does then you can\n
 remove this installer.\n"
