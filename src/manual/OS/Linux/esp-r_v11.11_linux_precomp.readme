      ESP-r Self-extracting Installer
                Version 11.11
                   July 2011

The 'run' file is a self-extracting installer
for a precompiled ESP-r version 11.11. The installer
offers two versions of ESP-r - a GTK graphics library
version and an X11 version. The GTK version looks and
feels like the native Windows version of ESP-r but is
not quite as feature rich as the X11 version.  You can
pick one of these to use or install both and use a link_to
script to switch between them.

On most Linux boxes a file ending in .run will
be treated as an executable.

Typically the file esp-r_v11.11_linux_precomp.run
should be placed in /tmp and run (as root) from 
that folder via the command ./esp-r_v11.11_linux_precomp.run

If the installer does not execute you may have to
issue the following command to change its permissions:
  chmod a+x ./esp-r_v11.11_linux_precomp.run

It will ask you a number of questions and, if
successful it will place an ESP-r distribution
in the folders:
  /opt/esru/esp-r/
        bin
	climate
	databases
	manual
	training
	validation
	
During the install process look for directions for
adapting your PATH environment variable.  The
installer will create a bin folder in your home folder
and place link_to and lin_to_bash scripts in the bin
folder (which is usually part of your PATH environment)
to create links to your selected version of ESP-r. Once you
have checked that ESP-r modules run you can remove
the installer.

To start up the Project Manger not focused on any
specific model give the command 'esp-r' (without 
the quotes) in a command window.  If you want to
open a model that you created earlier use the OS
commands (e.g. cd) to go to the model 'cfg' folder
and include the model configuration file in the
command line:
   prj -file mymodel.cfg
 
To find out what command line options are available
for an ESP-r module use the -help option with
the module name e.g. 'clm -help' (without the quotes).

Note: the ESP-r executables were created on a Linux
box running Ubuntu 10.04 (Ubuntu 11.04 has not
been tested). These executables should also run
on 64-bit computers.  Native compiles on 64-bit exhibit
a few glitches and is slightly less stable.

The executables do have dependencies so you might have to
download a few libraries from your Linux distribution
site. The libraries are libX11 libg2c libm libc libgcc_s
libdl.

Check the ESRU web site for tutorials, publications as 
well as for information on how to join the ESP-r discussion 
list.

Of course you would never want to spend an hour making a
model when you can do it in a day so you will definitely
not  want to read the ESP-r Cookbook and assiciated
exercises which are available on the ESRU publications page.
