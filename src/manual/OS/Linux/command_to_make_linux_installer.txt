Steps in making a self extractor:

First compile a standard version of esp-r (X11 version) in the standard location
which on Linux should be /opt/esru.

Second go to /opt/esru and create a tar file of the bin docs esp-r lib and tutorial
folders (the example below includes a date string in the name of the tar file.

tar cf esp-r_X11_11.3_linux.tar bin esp-r lib tutorial
gzip -9 esp-r_X11_11.3_linux.tar

There should be a folder /opt/precompiled_for_linux and the gziped tar file should
be placed in it.

A similar process is taken for the GTK version.  Clear the standard location and compile
a new GTK version of esp-r. Create the tar file of the distribution and gzip it and
place it in the precompiled_for_cygwin folder.

tar cf esp-r_GTK_11.3_linux.tar bin esp-r lib tutorial

gzip -9 esp-r_GTK_11.3_linux.tar

Move the gziped tar file to /opt/precompiled_for_linux

In the precompiled_for_linux folder are a number of files as follows:

License (text which is used to advise the user on license conditions.
setup (a script which tells makeself.sh what to do during the extraction
      process.

The file that does most of the work is setup.  This needs to be edited
slightly to include the specific ...tar.gz files.  

The way that the self extractor is created is via a command similar
to the one below (adapt for your makeself.sh location):

~/bin/makeself-2.1.4/makeself.sh precompiled_for_linux esp-r_v11.3_linux_precomp.run "ESP-r V11.3 distribution for Linux (/opt/esru)" ./setup

The items are as follows makeself.sh is a general script that creates installers. makeself-2.1.4 can
be downloded from the web and it will create its own executables.  The command includes the full
path to where makeself.sh is located on your machine. The 2nd item is the name of the folder where
the files to be installed is located (as noted in the first step). The 3rd token is the name
of the 'run' file that is going to be created (a run file is the finished esp-r installer that
will be placed on the web). The string in quotes is a message that will be printed out when
the installer runs. And lastly ./setup is the edited setup script within the precompiled_for_linux
folder. This script needs to have a chmod a+x done on it.

~/bin/makeself-2.1.4/makeself.sh precompiled_for_linux esp-r_v11.3_linux_precomp.run "ESP-r V11.3 distribution for Linux (/opt/esru)" ./setup

It is A REALLY GOOD IDEA to test use of the self-extractor on a clean machine.
