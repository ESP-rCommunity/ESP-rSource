3.0 Introduction
.PP
There a number of simulation tools available for energy
efficient building design, ranging from simplified tools
to detailed simulation programs.
Several of these are described on Web pages that can be found via the
Web address given later in this section. To learn the capability
of such design tools, it is useful to study:
.IP a)
the types of analysis questions that they can address and
the benefits of using energy and environmental simulation;
.IP b)
how to use the tools; and
.IP c)
the underlying theory upon which the numerical processing and
analysis functions of the tools are based.
.PP
The exercises and assignments described in this section are
concerned with how to use one particular detailed simulation
program, ESP-r, but those following the course are encouraged
to also refer to related Web-based material.
.PP
In order to be able to use ESP-r and to appreciate the following
sections, it is assumed that you have access to a Unix workstation (you
will need a personal user account on the machine) and that you have
a number of basic computer skills.  A number of exercises have been designed
to progress ESP-r users from the category of novice to specialist
over a period of time which will depend on the individual's aptitude
and stamina. Once a level of proficiency has been attained, the exercises
of section 4 can be attempted.
.PP
With the exercises are ten
assignments which gradually increase in difficulty.
It is suggested that the course participant follows the
exercises and assignments in the order given.
The assignments serve a dual purpose. They enable the instructor to
assess whether or not the training material is being absorbed effectively. For
the course participant they form a series of "real world" consultancy
sub-tasks enabling the participant to check whether the training
material is understood, while at the same time placing ESP-r in a realistic context.
Each assignment has an associated prerequisite exercise,
such as learning email in the case of assignment 1.
The outcome of each assignment should be sent by electronic mail to the
supervisor.
.PP
The exercises and assignments can be accessed by a Web browser, and it is
suggested that they are constantly displayed in one window as the
course participant progresses through the course.

The course participant should follow links from this high level
page to ESP-r training courses and from there to the structured
exercises.
