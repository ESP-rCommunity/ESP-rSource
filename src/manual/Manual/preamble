Development history and acknowledgements
.LP
The ESP-r system has evolved to its present form
over more then two decades. From 1974 to 1977 Joe Clarke
developed the initial prototype as part of his doctoral
research. Then, over the period 1977 to 1980, with funding from
the (then) UK Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC), ESP-r was
refined in a number of respects: the system was reorganised
and documented, validation trials commenced, multi-zone processing
was implemented and a graphics orientated user interface was
established. From 1981 through 1986 Professor Clarke was joined by
Dr Don McLean and, with further funding from SERC and from the CEC,
ESP-r's capabilities were extended by the addition of dynamic
plant simulation, the inclusion of building air flow modelling, a move
to low cost Unix\s-2\uTM\d\s0 workstation technology and the installation
of expert system primitives.
.LP
In 1987, the Energy Simulation Research Unit (ESRU) was formed to address
the problems confronting the further evolution of building energy and
environmental simulation.  As part of its research portfolio, ESRU has
continued to evolve ESP-r - most notably within the
framework of the UK Department of Energy's (now Trade and Industry)
Passive Solar Programme, the CEC's PASSYS
project (a 10 member country concerted action in Passive Solar Architecture),
a SERC funded project to establish an intelligent front-end
for the package and within a number of ongoing projects
concerned with plant and control simulation. These
activities ensured that ESP-r
continued to evolve, in terms of further validation, technical
extensions and user interface improvements.
.LP
Over the past two decades many individuals have made valuable contributions
to ESP-r developments. The most important of these have come from our
research colleagues at the University of Strathclyde who have contributed
much in the way of computational methods and technical support.
In particular we are indebted to Tom Maver, Harvey
Sussock, Alan Bridges, Don Stearn and Iain Forrest (all
presently or previously of ABACUS). One other colleague
springs readily to mind: Damian Mac Randal, now a project leader within the
Informatics Department at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. He was
the driving force behind our move to Unix workstations.
.LP
We also extend our thanks to several other individuals: to Fred Winklemann
of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory who helped to develop ESP-r's time-step
control mechanism; to Cor Pernot of the FAGO group in Eindhoven who installed
ESP-r's comfort routines and continues to take an active
interest in the system; to Jeremy Cockroft, who worked on
the original air flow solver upon which we have built over the years;
to Dr Dechao Tang, Dr Essam Aasem, Dr Abdullatif Nakhi, Dr Cezar Negrao and
Dr Tin-tai Chow, all formerly PhD students at ESRU,
who worked on ESP-r's plant, moisture flow and CFD algorithms.

At the present time the researchers actively involved in ESP-r
developments at ESRU include

About this User Guide
.LP
We assume that the user is familiar with some of the more elementary
Unix/\^Linux commands and is able to use a Unix/\^Linux workstation. The main purpose
of this User Guide is to introduce a new user of ESP-r to the
system and to provide training guidance.
.LP
Note that ESP-r has
extensive in-built tutorial and help facilities which can be
consulted throughout the system familiarisation process.
Detailed information may also be found in ESRU's World-Wide-Web
pages <http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk>
and in the Appendices to this User Guide which cover the system's data
requirements, operational details, worked examples,
adding new features to ESP-r, developers good practice guide,
implementation procedure and software structure.
.LP
This User Guide only comprises the essential reading material for
the first time user of ESP-r, organised in the following sections:
.IP 1
Outline of
the system structure and examples
of the types of design questions ESP-r can be used to answer.
.IP 2
General guidance on how to make effective use of the system.
.IP 3
A series of consecutive exercises allowing the first time user to become
familiar with - and appreciate - the comprehensive features of the system.
.IP 4
A number of short case study descriptions illustrating the use
of ESP-r in practice.
.IP 5
Some information and references on the theoretical basis and
validity of the system.
