4.0 Introduction
.LP
Sections 4.1 through 4.11 presents a number of short case studies of typical
and atypical designs as analysed by ESP-r. They have been selected
to indicate the possibilities for performance assessment by
simulation.  The remaining sections describe a number of simulation
exercises based on exemplars supplied with the system. 
These have a dual role: to test the ESP-r program
modules on first implementation and to provide training for
new users thereafter. The exercises progress from the simple
to the more complex and have been designed to test several aspects of
ESP-r. Each of the training sessions deals with a basic problem
type with variations which explore simulation topics.
.LP
Throughout the exercises reference is made to standard ESP-r
databases and test files. As explained elsewhere,
such files are held in a strict directory structure.
In the text that follows the Unix syntax is used so
that ~esru/esp-r/climate means sub-directory climate of sub-directory
esp-r of the home directory (wherever
defined) of esru. Similarly ~esru/esp-r/training/office means sub-directory
office of sub-directory training of sub_directory esp-r of
the home directory of esru.
.SH
4.1 Parametric studies
.LP
Parametric analysis of building energy performance is, perhaps, the
prerequisite of a more complete understanding of the issues relating
to energy efficient building design. The process of simulation can
be used to increase the corpus of knowledge upon which future designs
can be built. ESP-r has been used as the simulation tool in a number
of parametric studies.
.LP
In one, different window designs were analysed in terms of their
performance in British and Scandinavian climates. Annual simulations
were performed for a number of combinations of facade orientation,
window size, window type and fabric capacity sampled from the many
combinatorial possibilities. Typical occupancy patterns, internal gains
and window curtain operation was assumed throughout. The different windows
were then analysed in terms of the cost-benefit associated with
the provision of varying comfort standards.
.LP
In another study, the model was used to generate design guidelines
in public buildings by systematically varying the major design
parameters such as insulation, capacity, window size, heating system
regulation and degree of air permeability.
.SH
4.2 Upgrading strategy
.LP
Many Government agencies in the UK own housing stock which dates from
the early 1950's. In recent times much of this stock has fallen due
for upgrading. Obviously some mechanism must be employed to establish
the most productive strategy. ESP-r has been used as such a mechanism.
.LP
A sample of houses in any estate are analysed, firstly in their
original form, and subsequently with a range of alternative
upgrading features formulated on the basis of the initial simulation
results. In one case, the prime heat loss path was identified by ESP-r
as being through the suspended timber floor. This occurred in a building
for which substantial wall insulation was planned. As a result the
upgrading proposal was modified and the client's investment put
to better use.
.SH
4.3 The issue of cost
.LP
ESP-r was once used by a large regional council to investigate
the possibilities in a proposed building conversion. The study involved
an in-depth investigation into heating demand diversity as affected
by alternative zoning strategies, plant control schedules and
fabric treatments. Their resulting report included the technical
details of the project but went on to raise the following general
points.
.IP \(bu
The total cost incurred by them in the simulation exercise was
calculated at half the cost incurred in a parallel exercise
which involved only the calculation of zone heat loss by
conventional `manual' methods.
.IP \(bu
The results from the ESP-r exercise allowed a more detailed
analysis of both the building and plant performance than would have
been possible by other means. In particular, the ability to interactively
impose design changes was considered to be extremely useful.
.IP \(bu
The graphical presentation of results was considered invaluable as a
means of conveying information to the design team.
.SH
4.4 Inovatory design
.LP
ESP-r has also been used to test inovatory design solutions.
In one application, the program was used 
to model a proposed solar wall construction
which formed part of a multi-million
pound laboratory complex.
.LP
The movement of large quantities of air had
suggested a design solution in which this air was passed
over the entire south-facing building facade
and contained within an outer glass skin.
ESP-r was used to simulate this solar wall
to predict the potential annual pick-up
of solar energy and the corresponding reduction of 
the south facade heat loss due to the insulating
effect of the additional glass and air space combination.
.LP
Modelling of the system was complicated by the proposed
inclusion of ducts within the air space which caused
wall shading as well as convective heat pick-up.
What was required was a first principle computation
method capable of modelling the complexities
of the system.
.SH
4.5 Low energy housing
.LP
In conjunction with a private architectural practice
ESP-r was used by the modelling team to develop a specification for a 
low energy house.  Primary objectives were to
select a building mass and insulation scheme
which, in conjunction with the selected window
configuration, would effectively minimise the
heating demand.  Using real climatic data, initial
simulations resulted in decisions on orientation,
shape, zoning, window size and window type.
Later simulations - assuming real occupancy
and plant operational patterns - aided decisions on
fabric weight, position of thermal capacity,
position of insulation, and effective solar
screening to avoid overheating during peak
solar times.  Issues relating to controlled
ventilation and heat distribution between
different zones were also examined.
.LP
The final scheme was then rigorously analysed 
over whole year periods and, in this way, efficient
energy performance was established.
.SH
4.6 Re-design
.LP
ESP-r was used to investigate re-design issues
in converting a large dockland complex to house departments
of a polytechnic.  The exercise involved an analysis
of the relationship between the existing massive
construction and the potential overheating resulting
from solar penetration and the introduction of high internal
loads.  The possible set of conversion solutions 
were constrained by the existence of a preservation
order prohibiting substantive changes to the building
facade.  The restriction on facade shading devices
focused attention on the cost-benefit associated
with various glazing types in terms of their
ability to minimise solar penetration.  ESP-r
was used to find a suitable economic solution.
.SH
4.7 Critical control
.LP
In another new design application ESP-r was used by
a central government agency to analyse critical
environmental conditions in an astronomical
laboratory where control of 
the thermal environment is crucial to the 
effective working of the telemetry equipment.
.LP
ESP-r was used to select a constructional scheme which would
ensure that internal, untreated conditions would remain
within $+-$0.1\(deC of the required
condition.  The proposed massive concrete construction had a large
thermal time constant which had rendered simple
predictive techniques unsuitable.
.SH
4.8 Feasibility study
.LP
A large practice was asked to carry out a 
feasibility study and produce a development
scheme for the comprehensive redevelopment 
of a narrow but important urban site;  the
redevelopment had to include two office blocks,
each of 100,000 $ft sup 2$, to be let by the client.
The narrowness of the site suggested a narrow
floor plan in each office block, one rising to
six stories, the other to eight stories.  The
proposal that one of the blocks should be air
conditioned, the other not, suggested to the
architect an investigation of a broad range of
construction types under `artificial', 
`ambient', and `assisted', environmental control.
.LP
In the event, a two-stage ESP-r analysis 
was carried out in the context of the non-air
conditioned building.  In the first stage, office
modules on the SW and NE orientations were simulated,
respectively, under summer and winter conditions;
within a fixed external envelope with 35% glazing.
ESP-r was used to explore the implications of achieving
shading on the SW facade, increasing the thermal mass
of internal partitioning, altering the rate of
mechanical ventilation and double-glazing the
NE facade.  In the second stage, more explicit
proposals were generated for the pattern of external
glazing, the internal sub-division of space, etc;
and a similar series of investigations, using ESP-r,
carried out.
.SH
4.9 Late design-stage use
.LP
The design of a building to house a computer and ancillary
activities for a nationalised industry was already
well advanced when then the opportunity arose to
use ESP-r.  The air conditioned building, of approximately
6000 $m sup 2$, was to be built on four floors, each 30m wide
by 50m long;  office accommodation would be housed on
the perimeter with rooms of more occasional occupancy
in the core.
.LP
The stimulus for use of a dynamic energy model came
from the late decision to alter the building envelope
from a lightweight metal cladding system to brickwork,
with an associated increase in glazing from 25% to 40%,
differentially arranged in the four floors.  The effect
of these changes on the variable air volume (VAV) 
distribution ductwork and on the central air-handling
plant needed, as a matter of urgency, to be determined.
.LP
The ESP-r analysis was applied to spatial modules sited
on all four corners of the building and halfway along
each facade.  For each module, on each floor, the peak
load across the VAV terminals was computed and the
accumulative effect on the central plant estimated.
In relation to the climate data used the peak load
on all space modules was seen to occur on a high air
temperature July day and not, as had been previously assumed,
within the month of September when solar angles are
lower.  The ability of ESP-r to model the dynamics of
thermal behaviour, hour by hour, showed clearly that
the peak load occurred in different space modules at
different times throughout the critical day;  as a
consequence, although individual VAV terminal duties
had to be increased, no significant increase in 
load would be experienced by the central plant.
.SH
4.10 Comfort
.LP
The first phase of an extension to a University Library
comprised a reading room with a floor of bookstacks above.
The construction proposed by the architect was dense
reinforced concrete with double skin patent glazing
angled back from sill to ceiling.
.LP
Concern for the environmental conditions focused on
the maximum occupancy period of the reading room (May 
with an estimated 350 readers) and on the mid-summer 
period (June to August, with an estimated 100 readers);
the architect also wished an appraisal of the scheme 
under winter heating conditions.
.LP
Climatic data relevant to the study period were created in
accordance with the diurnal range known to prevail at the
location of the site.  The May analysis received a 24 hour
heat input requirement under the proposed 10 air changes
per hour ventilation regime;  as a result of the analysis
the proposed air change rate in the Spring was
reduced to a level just sufficient to combat odours
and meet ventilation requirements.  With 10 air changes
per hour in August, the maximum temperature was
predicted to be 24\(deC.  Given the slightly lower
predicted resultant temperature and the possibility
of the 100 readers disposing themselves away from the
external wall this was considered to be acceptable.
A January analysis of heat flow through the double-glazed
envelope revealed acceptable comfort conditions.
.SH
4.11 Speculative development
.LP
In another exercise ESP-r was used, in the context of speculative
office developments, to:
.IP \(bu
Estimate the relative influence on energy conservation
of different external wall constructions and window
treatments.
.IP \(bu
Compare the generated 'best-buy' solution with other
existing schemes.
.IP \(bu
Ascertain the impact of such an approach to capital
expenditure (the developer's contribution)
and running costs (the tenant's contribution).
.LP
The analysis indicated that:
.IP \(bu
Changes to the fabric alone can result in a +16% or a
-24% alteration to the winter heating load relative to
the standard.
.IP \(bu
Double glazing had a similar effect to that of adding
a suspended ceiling, namely a 23% saving of winter energy.
.IP \(bu
Substituting internal fabric blinds for external blinds
in winter saves about 12% which is comparable to the thermal
benefit of retaining full light output.
.IP \(bu
There is no apparent advantage in reducing still further
the construction U-value.
.IP \(bu
Peak cooling demands do not show an exactly negative
correlation with peak heating load levels, suggesting that
a balance in the fabric/services system between winter
and summer conditions may be achievable.
.LP
From the study, the architect was able to provide a base
of relevant data and conclude generally that, `if a developer
seeks to offer a good level of environment, it may be
advantageous to the tenant in terms of running costs
to do so by means of design changes to the building
rather than by introducing air conditioning'.
.bp
.SH
4.12 Training Exemplars
.LP
The ESP-r system offers a model archiving and browsing facility
by which past problems can be maintained and revisited.  On delivery,
this facility is used to provide a number of exemplar problems
which are useful for training support.  The following sections
relate to some of these on-line exemplar models.
.SH
4.12.1 Single office
.LP
Figure 4.1.1 gives the geometry, construction and operation details
for a single building zone containing office and computing equipment.
The user would begin by creating a directory for this problem and
moving into it and running ESP-r which contains or allows access
to the facilities required to describe the problem, commission
simulations and engage in analysis of the results.  
.LP
The opening display provides a tutorial, database management facility,
problem definition, problem simulation and analysis and various
support facilities.  If the user is a novice it is recommended
that some time be spent using the tutorial facility.
.LP
When testing ESP-r it is not necessary to create the problem
description files since they
are supplied. In directory \fI~esru/esp-r/training/simple\fR, the
files \fIcfg/bld_simple.cfg\fR, \fIzones/reception.geo\fR, \fIzones/reception.con\fR,
\fIzones/reception.opr\fR and \fIctl/bld_simple.ctl\fR
correspond to the system configuration, zone geometry, zone
construction, zone operation and configuration
control files respectively.  All that is required is to
select \fIproblem definition\fR and supply the problem
name \fIbld_simple.cfg\fR which will then be loaded.  At this point
the user may explore the details of the problem or commission
a simulation.  Notes supplied with the problem should be read
by selecting \fIproblem registration:documentation\fR from within the
\fIproblem definition\fR, accepting the file \fIbld_simple.log\fR
and then reading the text displayed in the text feedback area.
.LP
Of course it is also possible to describe
this problem from scratch yourself. Although
the user may approach this task of in
a number of ways, the following sequence is suggested.
.LP
The first task is to select \fIdatabase management\fR which
allows various databases to be
associated with a project.  In most cases the defaults provided
for climate, pressure distribution, primitive constructions, 
event profiles, plant components and optical properties will 
not need to be changed.  Indeed some may not be used, but
a multi-layered constructions database 
will need to be defined for the current problem.  This database
defines the details of wall floor and ceiling constructions - i.e.
order, thickness and references to elements in the construction 
primitives database. To create a new multi-layered constructions 
database simply supply a new file name and a fresh database
with a dummy construction will be created.  
.LP
For each of the
constructions shown in Figure 4.1.1 follow the editing
procedures - beginning with the outside face and working
in to the layer which faces the zone.  You may
edit, add or delete an individual layer as necessary.  In the
case of the double glazing it is necessary to match the
properties of the optical database and the best way to do
this is to specify the optical properties first and then
allow a matching set of layers to be created.  It is
a good idea to \fIupdate\fR the database frequently. When you
have finished the details should be as in Figure 4.1.2.
Note that you can also use any text editor to 
change this file (test.mlc).

.LP
Exit from the database facility and select \fIproblem definition\fR
and, after reading the message, supply the new problem name \fIbld_simple.cfg\fR,
indicate that you wish to begin with a new geometry from scratch and supply
a name for the zone (this name is for reporting and display purposes
and is not the file name).
.LP
The zone is most easily described as an extruded shape and after
you have supplied the floor and ceiling height as well as the
coordinates of the various corners and the connections between this corners,
 you will be presented with
a display similar to that in Figure 4.1.3. Use the 
\fIgeometry-->surface attributes\fR option from the \fIproblem definition\fR
menu to adapt the (zone)geometry of the problem.

Note that the surfaces have been given default names. 
Clarity of presentation 
is enhanced by replacing the default surface
names with names which make sense in the context of
a given building.  Use the \fIsurface attribute\fR selection
to accomplish this.
.LP
Glazing is representation as a multi-layered construction
with additional optical properties. The surface of the glazing
can be any polygonal shape, although many users will 
define glazing as an offset from the lower left corner
of an existing surface to the lower left corner of the glazing as well
as its width and height. 
.LP
From the \fIgeometry\fR menu some other subjects like \fIsolar
insolation distribution\fR, \fIobstruction blocks\fR and \fIrotation &
transforms\fR can be selected. These options are not relevant to the test
case you are working on at this moment; later on, when you have seen some 
results of this first test, some shading distributions will be added.
.LP  
At this point the zone will contain information similar to 
that in Figure 4.1.4.

The next descriptive task is to define the thermophysical
properties of the zone.  The recommended procedure is to use
the \fIsurface attribute\fR facility and for each surface
select the appropriate construction.  In the case of
the glazing in the south wall make sure that it is marked
as transparent.  Having defined these attributes 
proceed to use the \fIconstruction browse/ edit\fR 
facility to create a zone construction file.  Since there
is a transparent wall in the zone a zone 
TMC file is required. ESP-r knows about
the file structure dependencies and will automatically
generate such files.  After reading 
in the geometry (including the surface attributes) ESP-r
will attempt to create the necessary files.  During
the creation process it will ask you to confirm that
glz_s is transparent, otherwise the process is automatic.
You may browse through any of the surfaces thermophysical
properties and unless a change is demanded the data
can be merged into the problem.
The thermophysical properties are contained in \fIreception.con\fR
which is listed below in Figure 4.1.5.

There are several points within \fIESP-r\fR where information
related to the problem topology can be supplied.  Within
the \fIproblem definition\fR menu there is the 
\fIconnection and boundary\fR selection which allows
one or more of the connections to be manually edited, topology
to be checked and generated via a vertex matching algorithm or
topology to be imported from surface attribute boundary
specifications.  Within the
\fIgeometry browse & edit\fR facility you may specify
boundary conditions as surface attributes or import
the connection topology to the surface attributes. 
.LP
By definition, the initial assumption 
for the topology of a problem is that all surfaces face
the outside.  This can be confirmed by exiting to 
the \fIproblem definition\fR menu and consulting the
\fIconnection and boundary\fR selection.  As most
of the walls face the outside a quick way
to update the surface boundary attributes is to
return to the \fIgeometry browse & edit\fR and select
\fIupdate topology from problem\fR. 
.LP
Two surfaces in the zone do not face the outside
and this can be defined in two ways:
.IP 1)
supply the boundary for the other side of the 'passage'
and the 'floor' as surface attributes and then exit to
the \fIconnection and boundary\fR and import this
information or;
.IP 2)
edit the connection in the \fIconnection and boundary\fR 
display and then move to the \fIgeometry browse & edit\fR
and import the information.

After updating the problem (system configuration) file
\fIsimple_office\fR should look like the listing in Figure 4.1.9

Now a configuration control file must be created using 
the \fIbuilding controls & actuation\fR facility. This
file contains the control statements to be obeyed by the \fISimulator\fR at
simulation time. This file can be
confusing for some users of \fIESP-r\fR.  Previous releases
provided only minimal editing facilities, however \fIESP-r\fR
includes a extensive editing and reporting facilities
which should ease the process considerably.

A simulation is now performed via the \fISimulator\fR using the climate file
\fI~esru/esp-r/climate/clm67\fR. Two simulations should
be performed, saving both in the same
results library called, for example, \fIex1.res\fR.
The first should span the period 9th January to
15 January inclusive. The second should span
the period 11 July to 17 July inclusive. Both simulations should
have a one hour time-step.
.LP
Now \fIResults Analysis Module\fR is used to see the results obtained from the simulation.
After entering the library name (\fIex1.res\fR in this case) you can
select \fIgraph\fR, \fItime-variable\fR and \fIinside air temperature\fR
to obtain a common temperature-profile of the inside air. According to
these profiles (see figures), the following items can be 
discussed (you should generate these profiles yourself):
.IP 1)
In winter the maximum heating capacity of the actuated control is not 
satisfactory to achieve the heating setpoint (20\(deC from 9h00 to 18h00)
of the inside air. To perform the next simulation, you can change
this maximum heating capacity for instance up to 3000 [W], you will
notice that now -during weekdays- the setpoint temperature is reached 
during the afternoon (figure 4.1.11 and 4.1.13). The
new control file is listed below in figure 4.1.12.
.IP 2)
In summer the cooling setpoint (100\(deC from 7h00 to 18h00) never actuates
the cooling capacity because this setpoint-temperature never occurs. In
the new control file (figure 4.1.11) this setpoint-temperature is adapted to
25\(deC actuating a cooling capacity of 3000 W. If you
generate a temperature-profile now you can see that the 
inside air temperature is decreased during weekday.

4.12.1b Additional shading analysis
.LP
In the previous test, only a default insolation
distribution has been used (i.e.. all internal surfaces
receiving diffuse solar incidence). Before defining
the geometry of the first test, we didn't take any notice of subjects like \fIsolar
insolation distribution\fR, \fIobstruction blocks\fR and \fIrotation &
transforms\fR. These subjects affect the time-series dependent solar incidence.
.LP
In order to increase the resolution of the problem (to make the problem more
corresponding to reality) a second variant is included
called \fIbld_simple_shd.cfg\fR. You may access this by specifying it as the
problem name and the relevant information will be loaded. As you can see a 
large obstruction (for instance a flat-block) is created at the south-side
of the office.
.LP
If you select \fIobstruction blocks\fR from the \fIgeometry\fR-menu
you can see in detail that this obstruction is build out of four
blocks. In this menu you now can change the geometry of this blocks
in order to make it cope with the outdoor situation you wish to
simulate. Again don't forget to update this new situation into the
new obstruction file. Obstruction data are listed below in Figure 4.1.14.

The next action to perform is to go back to the main
menu and to start the \fIShading/ Insolation Module\fR
via the \fIshading & insolation\fR option. This program
calculates the insolation distribution and it writes the
results to a database for use in subsequent simulations. 
.LP
The results that you will obtain now show no
difference in winter. In this period the solar
radiation is not remarkable. However in summer
(cooling capacity 1000 W, actuated at 25\(deC) a
slight difference occurs as you can see from
Figure 4.1.15. Note that in these figures the
internal and external surface temperatures of the
south wall are drawn instead of the inside air temperature.

If no shading/insolation database exists,
the default insolation distribution of the zone operations file
will be used. In this case ESP-r assumes no obstructions so
that only the building geometry is needed for calculation
of the insolation distribution.

We now move to a multi-zone problem and ask
what will be the effect on winter heating energy and summer overheating. Again
there is no need to generate the zone and configuration files
since the data has already been prepared
and can be copied from directory  \fI~esru/esp-r/training/basic\fR.
.LP
This directory contains several subdirectories including one that contains 
different problem configurations. A discussion of each of the problems
is contained in the files
\fIcfg/bld_basic*.log\fR which may be looked at via a text
editor or by the facilities provided in the project manager. A
summary of these configurations is included below.

Each problem assumes the same building geometry and
construction, only different utilities are added. The
building geometry is shown below in Figure 4.2.1.
.LP
Rather than list each of the different problem files
the user is invited to make use of the display facilities
within the project manager or the various UNIX file
listing facilities. At least you should list the
different configuration files to see how the \fIbld_basic.cfg\fR
geometry is used for describing different problems.
.LP
Now perform the same winter and summer simulations as
were performed initially in training session 1 for the
base case problem \fIbld_basic.cfg\fR. Using the results
analysis program you should now compare your results
with the corresponding results for the winter period 9
to 15 January in the following listings (assuming the default climate collection).

Figure 4.2.2 Tabular statistics during winter simulation period.

.LP
From this tabular report you can see that during the
simulation period, the office requires most heating
energy (46 kWh) while the reception looses most energy
(160 kWh). The energy statistics table and the causal
energy breakdown table show that the reception zone
loses most energy due to conduction (total 80 kWh).
However the reception zone also suffers a high casual
gain from equipment (type 3) so the reception net heat
loss is less than the office net heat loss.
.LP
If you look to the operation files you will see that a
coupled air flow from the reception into the office
is defined. In the listed energy statistics you can
see that (due to this interzonal airflow) the heat
loss from the reception to the office is more or less 10 kWh.
.LP
Next you should perform the same simulation for the
summer (11-17 July) and generate a tabular report. You
will obtain results as listed below.

Figure 4.2.3 Tabular statistics during summer simulation period.

.LP
The heat loss due to the conduction through building
partitions is less and infiltration & ventilation becomes
the greatest heat loss factor. Because of the internal
casual gains and the high cooling setpoint-temperature
(100\(deC as you can see from the control file) no
heating or cooling energy is required.
.LP
For example now it is interesting to run a simulation
(winter and summer) to establish the heating and cooling
energy required to maintain the zone 1 and 2 air temperatures
constant at a setpoint of 24\(deC during the control period.
.LP
Therefore, first you should adapt the control file (or
make a new one) to change the capacity and setpoint temperatures
of both the heating and cooling plant. You can enter an
extremely high capacity in order to be sure that the
set-point temperature is reached when the control period starts.
You should run the simulations and check
the calculated temperature profiles using the \fIResults Analysis Module\fR.
Finally, you can find the required energy data from the energy statistics.
.LP
When you perform the simulations correctly, you will
find 60 and 70 kWh respectively for the reception and
the office in winter and 130 and 6 kWh in summer. Due
to the high casual gain in the reception less heating
energy is required in winter and more cooling energy is required in summer.
You can perform the same simulations as has been done
for the basic problem configuration, for the other configurations.

4.12.2b Additional fluid flow analysis
.LP
At the start of training session 2, a
summary of the files \fIbld_basic*.log\fR was given.
As you can see, two problem definition files exist in
which fluid flows are governed by a flow network. Below, a
summary of these problem definition files is included.

.LP
The basic building with air movement is restricted to flows via
crack openings (under doors and around windows) in the occupied
spaces. Separately, the roof is  vented  by  soffit  and
ridge   vents.    Use   the   configuration   control   file
bld_basic.ctl which  provides  1kW   to   the  reception  and
office.
.LP
A variation is the base case with the addition of a component
`door'  between the rooms in the mass flow network and a window
which is controlled.  Browse and use the
configuration control file \fIbld_basic_af2.ctl\fR.
.LP
The  base  case  mass   flow   network   is   described   in
\fIbld_basic_af1.afn\fR  and  contains  four  boundary  nodes (north,
east, south, west) and  three  nodes  (roof,  recep,  offic)
which match the thermal zones.  Mass flow components (drcrk,
wincrk, soffit, roofv) define the  flow  restrictions.   The
flow  paths are between each zone and the outside via window
cracks and between the two occupied rooms via a crack  under
the  door.  The roof space has two flow paths to the outside
- one through the soffit and one by way of the roof vent.
.LP
The mass flow network with window control is \fIbld_basic_af2.afn\fR.
The control is made via a configuration control file \fIbld_basic_af2.ctl\fR. A
window in the reception is assumed to open if the room
temperature rises above 20\(deC.  A similar set of paths is
defined for the office.
.LP
During a summer simulation the flow is restricted to the
cracks in the windows until the room warms. Then the
window opens, flow is allowed and then when the temperature
drops below 20\(deC the window closes.  In the results
analysis you will probably detect a sawtooth pattern as  the
window opens and closes. The decision to open or close the
window is only taken once per timestep and you should experiment
with different simulation timesteps to see how this
ventilation control changes.
.LP
As it is important to check the \fIleakage characteristic\fR
of a space, we will first discuss a simple simulation of the fan pressurisation method.
.LP
A simple fan pressurisation apparatus consists essentially
of a large variable-speed fan with an attached air flow
measuring station. The rig is sealed into the doorway of
the space under test with internal and external connections
taken to a differential micromanometer. The flow rate is
measured over a range of pressure differences between 10
and 100 Pascals and the results presented as a curve of
volume flow rate against pressure difference. This curve
(with leakage parameters k and n) can be fitted by an expression of the form;
.EQ
~~~Q~=~k{( DELTA P)} sup n
.EN
.LP
In order to simulate fan pressurisation, a mass flow
network description as printed in Figure 4.2.4 can be used.
Only air leakages (door and window cracks) in the reception
zone (space under test) are considered. These air leakages
(or flow restrictions) are determined by a thorough
investigation of the room partitions. The fan
pressurisation apparatus is simulated by a constant
mass flow component in the east door. By altering
the constant mass flow rate and reading the corresponding
pressure differences from the results file, the leakage
curve can be calculated (Figure 4.2.5).

Figure 4.2.5 Leakage characteristic (simulated) for the
reception zone. The graph is drawn by use of copying
the predicted flow data to the XVGR tool.
.LP
The leakage characteristic as printed above should be
compared with data acquired by performing a fan
pressurisation (as already explained). In case
differences occur between measured data and
simulation results, flow restrictions
should be altered. For now we assume simulation results
to be correct (i.e. more or less in agreement with the measured data).
Reading National Standards on pressurisation testing
you will find these leakage parameters to be very low and satisfying.
.LP
Now, when copying leakage data of various zones to an
overall building mass flow network, you are able
to perform accurate simulations concerning energy
gains and losses due to infiltration and ventilation.
Results for a winter's simulation are printed
below in Figure 4.2.6. Comparing these data to
the ones printed in Figure 4.2.2 you will find
the reception infiltration and ventilation energy loss to be less.

Figure 4.2.6 Tabular energy statistics of winter simulation

.LP
In the basic problem configuration, air change rates
of infiltration and ventilation were estimated by 0.3
(~ 43 $m sup 3 /h$) and 1.0 (~ 144 $m sup 3 /h$) for the reception zone. If
you analyse your mass flow results you will find these rates
to be overestimated. With known wind pressure coefficients and
wind velocities as boundary conditions, air flows of
the reception are in order of magnitude of 10 $m sup 3 /h$ for
both infiltration and ventilation. Note that we already
mentioned the leakage parameters to be very low.
.LP
Finally two temperature profiles (Figure 4.2.7) are added for the
reception and office zone. These profiles show the
difference calculated between the basic problem
(solid line) and the combination with fluid flow simulation (dashed line).

4.12.3 Small house
.LP
This training session focuses on the training directory
\fIhouse/sun_space\fR which holds the description of a small 
dwelling proposed for a remote
Scottish island.  It is designed for high exposure locations.
The provision
of a unheated but protected space for inclement weather
is part of the design brief.  Because of site constraints
the model is rotated so that the lounge faces south-west.
The dwelling is defined with ten thermal zones:
.nf
1) combined kitchen and lounge (kitliv)
2) hollow south-west wall (west_space)
3) passage (hall)
4) bathroom (bath)
5) bedroom (bed1)
6) bedroom (bed2)
7) buffer south-west portion (buf_1)
8) buffer north-east portion (buf_2)
9) upper buffer (buf_roof)
10) roof over occupied space (roof)
.fi
.LP
The dwelling has deep window reveals and its orientation 
suggests that a
detailed treatment of shading and solar penetration is
called for.  To this end obstruction blocks define the
deep window reveals in the bedrooms and kitchen/lounge
and correctly limit sunlight entering the dwelling.
.LP
The model uses seasonally adjusted mass flow networks to 
predict air movements.  There are timed extract fans in 
the kitchen and bathroom as well as logic to open the 
windows during particular hours and if internal 
temperatures rise above a particular point. This is 
defined in the configuration control file.
.LP
The subdivision of the buffer space into three thermal 
zones allows warm air to rise into the upper space but 
for the front and back of the space to evolve different 
temperatures as a result of solar radiation patterns.
This requires that `fictitious' boundaries be used
between the zones and project based optical properties
and multilayer construction databases have been created.
.LP
Of interest is the treatment of the south-west wall of the
lounge as a separate thermal zone rather than as a 
conventional multilayer construction.  The reason for 
this is the large void (300mm) within this wall which, 
thus described, will have a more detailed treatment of 
radiant exchanges.
.LP
There are two configuration files, \fIhouse_win.cfg\fR which is used
for winter simulations and \fIhouse_sum.cfg\fR for summer simulations.
Similarly there are two mass flow network descriptions
(\fIss_sum.afn\fR and \fIss_win.afn\fR for summer and winter respectively).
The control file \fIss_win.ctl\fR should be used with winter
simulations and\fI ss_sum.ctl\fR with summer simulations.
.LP
To browse the fluid flow network associated with
a given problem use the appropriate command of the
project manager.  The winter fluid flow network with
the corresponding control functions is listed
below.

Six simulations were performed; three simulations in which both temperatures and
ventilation were controlled according to Table 4.3.2 and three
simulations in which only
temperatures were controlled and ventilation was governed by
the original mass flow description
as printed in Figure 4.3.1. January 1967 from the climate file clm67

Figure 4.3.3 Control file for simulation of normal occupants use.
.sp
.LP
The simulation results (i.e. total energy consumption in january) are gathered
in Table 4.3.4. Occupants use E- and E+ are of the same frequent occurrence as
type N: the simulation shows that energy consumption for this
house will vary ~230 kWh (15%) within this range of common occupants use. 
You can also see that the roof needs extra insulation
in order to decrease energy consumption.
Besides, the simulations with mass flow description
show that the original mass flow description
correlates (in terms of energy consumption) with the E+ occupants use.

4.12.4 Large house
.LP
Increasing the complexity of the models we now turn
to the training directory \fIhouse/svph\fR which 
is an example of a moderate size
dwelling based on a direct gain house
in Milton Keynes.  It has become a
\fIde facto\fR modelling standard within the UK.
.LP
The directory structure, as for other exemplars described above,
is an example of using several subdirectories to hold
different portions of the problem definition.
The benefit of this is that each directory
has only a limited number of files.

4.12.6 Special focus
.LP
There are a number of specialised facilities within ESP-r which
are provided for expert users and those who require additional
detail in their simulation work.  Several examples are given in
the exemplars. One example relates to
the thermophysical property replacement facility.
.LP
It is based on the simple_building problem. The
situation modelled in \fIconstr/tp_sub\fR is that the conductivity of the glass wool
in some of the external walls is increased when the internal 
air temperature rises above a certain temperature (20\(deC).
This is obviously not a real situation, but a similar situation
could occur if the conductivity of a particular constructional material
was sensitive to temperature.
.LP
An additional entry (glasswool_mod, #282) has been made in the 
primitives database (tp_subs.pdb). This is similar to glasswool (#211)
but with increased conductivity. A new entry has also been made in
the multi-constructional database (tp_subc.mlc) which is for ext_wall_mod.
This is the same as for the entry for extern_wall except that it
uses the modified properties of glasswool.
.LP
The control file demonstrates the activation of the replacement
constructions.  For the space named reception,
constructions 'south', 'east' and 'north', and for the office space,
constructions 'North_w' and 'West_w', use the replacement construction whenever
the room temperature exceeds 20\(deC.  In the control file, control
function 1 (assigned to the reception) has a 'nested' control function
3 which gives details of the thermophysical property control. Similarly,
control function 2 (for the office) has a 'nested' control function 4.

4.12.7 Office block
.LP
This session switches the focus to full scale commercial buildings
with a two level office block located in the north-east
of Scotland. The 17-zone model makes use
of mass flow simulation and opening of
windows to control summer overheating.
Images of the problem (in gif format) are
included in the images directory.
.LP
To access the problem definitions
go into the configuration directory. 
Within the configuration
directory is a file \fIoffice.log\fR which
should be viewed via UNIX or project manager
facilities.  
.LP
As this is a large problem it is recommended that
simulations be kept to a few days.  In summer simulations
you will note that the zone temperatures are to some
extent a function of wind velocity and direction.
