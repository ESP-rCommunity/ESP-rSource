0 Introduction
.PP
This report describes the implementation procedure to be followed
when installing ESP-r.  There are two alternative procedures for
acquiring the system: by electronic transfer (FTP) and by
tape medium.  The former is the preferred method, as it is much
faster and permits more frequent distribution of code updates.
.SH
1 FTP Transfer
.PP
The latest release of ESP-r is kept on a University of Strathclyde computer
that can be accessed by FTP.  FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is the
primary method for transferring files over the Internet, and
allows the copying of files from one computer to another
worldwide at reasonable transfer speeds (in the order of 5-10Kbyte/s).
The files are kept in compressed tar archives (esp-r?.tar.Z), 
and they can be accessed by the following procedure:
.DS
ftp ftp.strath.ac.uk
login>     esru
password>  ??????
           cd Esru/ESP-r
           dir
           get esp-r.list
           binary
           mget esp-r?.tar.Z    
           bye
.DE
.PP
The dir command gives a list of the files in the directory,
which will contain the compressed tar files and a file
called esp-r.list. The latter contains a listing of the files
in the archive. Note that it is important to set the 
binary switch before transferring the compressed tar files,
in order to prevent corruption. It is likely that the transfer 
will be significantly faster at night. Please contact ESRU
(preferably by email at esru@strath.ac.uk)
for the password and if you have trouble resolving the 
ftp hostname (ftp.strath.ac.uk).
.PP
Once the compressed tar files have been transferred, the ESP-r
files can be reconstituted with the "uncompress" and "tar x" commands.
.SH
2 ESP-r System Contents
.PP
The ESP-r system, as acquired by ftp, or by reading from 
a tape, will include some or all of the following files.
.sp 1
.IP \(bu
A README file containing further help on installation.
.IP \(bu
If source code is supplied, sets of files of type *.f, *.F
or *.c will exist for each program
module ??? where ??? = prj, bps, res, con, pro, pdb, pdf,
win, clm, ish, mfs, cfg, tut and mrt. 
These contain the FORTRAN77 or C source code
for the subroutines which comprise the module.
.IP \(bu
When working with source code, two libraries are also
required. These will be delivered as the general library
libesru.a and the graphics library. The graphics library is a shared
library named libXww.so.?.? for an X windows implementation
and libww.so.?.? for a Sun windows implementation.
Alternatively the libraries will be supplied as source and will
need to be compiled.
.IP \(bu
If executables are supplied, these will be called \fBprj\fR,
\fBbps\fR, \fBres\fR, \fBcon\fR, \fBpro\fR, \fBpdb\fR, \fBpdf\fR,
\fBwin\fR, \fBclm\fR, \fBish\fR, \fBmfs\fR, \fBcfg\fR, \fBtut\fR and \fBmrt\fR.
.IP \(bu
Files material.???, constr.???, multicon.???, plantc.???, pressc.???, profiles.??? and optics.??? 
are the primitive constructions, multi-constructions,
plant components, pressure coefficients, profiles and optical databases respectively.
If your machine is compatible with ours then some of these files will
be binary random access as required by ESP-r. In this case
??? = db1. Otherwise ??? = db1.a and these files are ascii
images of each database.  
The module \fBpdb\fR is used to create plantc.db1 (the binary version of
the plant template common file).
For reference, the following table sets out the names 
and format of databases used within the ESP-r system.

.TE
.IP \(bu
The file clm67 is a binary, random access climate file as
required by ESP-r. Again you may have been supplied with
clm67.a, the ascii equivalent. The program \fBclm\fR (which can be
invoked from the project manager) is used
to transform clm67.a to clm67. Since this file is only for testing
purposes, we recommend that you set the latitude, longitude difference
and year to 52, 0, 1967 in response to the questions you will be asked.
.IP \(bu
A training directory, containing exemplars ranging
from very simple to complex problems. Section 7 of the manual and
the on-line tutorial give details.
.IP \(bu
A defaults directory, useful for referencing frequently
used databases and files, especially during testing and training.
This directory contains links to other files: it may be
supplied as a tar file.
.IP \(bu
A manual, set in troff format.
.PP
The tarfiles or tape contents will already be
organised in a directory structure as described below.
.SH
3 Implementation Procedure
.PP
For Unix workstations, the implementation procedure is:
.IP 1.
Create a home directory /usr/esru. If necessary, this can 
be a link to a directory `esru' anywhere on the system.
You will need to be superuser to create this directory 
and/or link. cd to directory `esru'.
.IP 2.
If you have tarfiles transferred by ftp, move them to
your current directory (`esru'), then uncompress 
and "tar x" the files. In the case of a 
tape/cartridge/floppy, use "tar xf /dev/rst0" (or similar)
to restore the contents. This will create a directory src/esp-r,
lib and bin to contain the system contents as follows (note that
if the system has to be fully installed from scratch, some of these
directories will be created or moved during the install process):

.TE
.IP 3.
If the whole system including libraries needs to be made,
the system Makefile in ~esru/src/esp-r should be used.
Firstly, the Makefile should be edited so that
the correct environment variables are set for the
machine type and the location of the directory
containing the window manager libraries. 
Note that scripts wwl (for Sun windows) and xr5 (for X windows)
in ~esru/src/esp-r/bin are used by make to return workstation
specific libraries. These scripts should be moved to ~esru/bin,
and in the case of an X windows implementation, the script xr5
should be modified to point to the location of the X11 libraries.
Type `make' and follow instructions. In case of difficulties
with the ww graphics library, this can be made independently
by changing directory to ~esru/src/lib/ww_3.8/dd/x (for X windows)
or ~esru/src/lib/ww_3.8/dd/sun (for Sun windows) and typing
make. If successful the library can be moved to its
correct location, ~esru/lib.
.IP 4.
In a similar fashion, if the libraries are available
but not the individual ESP-r program executables, these
can be made using the system Makefile. For example,
to make the project manager, module `prj',
type "make prj".
.IP 5.
If you have not been sent the binary versions of the materials
database and the test climate, you should
have received their ascii equivalents. Use the project
manager to convert from ascii to binary.
.IP 6.
If the defaults directory contains a tarfile, this should be
exploded (tar xvf defaults.tar). If necessary, the links
should be modified to point to the required default databases
and/or files. Note that a default
result library is not supplied: if required, one called
test.res can be created by simulating a problem and placed
in the directory /usr/esru/esp-r/demo.
.IP 7.
Set the environment variables (examples are given in
directory env; see README) as appropriate
for X windows or Sun windows implementations.
.SH
4 Software Structures
.PP
For those who wish to modify/extend ESP-r,
the system source code is well commented
and organised into directories by function (ie common
utilities, graphics primitives, flow theory,
control algorithms, plant components, etc held separately).
Further details are available from ESRU on request.
