3.0 Introduction
.PP
In order to be able to use ESP-r and to appreciate the following
chapters, it is assumed that you have access to a Unix workstation (you
will need a personal user account on the machine) and that you have
a number of basic skills.  The exercises that follow
are designed to progress ESP-r users from the category of novice
to specialist over a period of time which will depend on
the individual's aptitude and stamina.
Once a level of proficiency has been attained, the exercises of
chapter 4 can be attempted.  It is suggested that the following
assignments are adhered to in the order given.
These assignments serve a dual purpose. They enable the instructor to
assess whether or not the training material is being absorbed effectively. For
the course participant they form a series of "real world" consultancy
sub-tasks enabling the participant to check whether the training
material is understood, while at the same time placing ESP-r in a realistic context.
Each assignment has an associated prerequisite exercise,
such as learning email in the case of assignment 1.
The outcome of each assignment should be send by electronic mail to the
supervisor.

For the "Single zone" exemplar: perform a one day simulation for
February 14 using default values for climate, start-up period, etc.
Analyse the results and mail the following: value and time of maximum heating
load, load levelling (= difference between maximum and minimum
heating load), energy consumption for heating during that day, and
the comfort assessment results assuming a person is engaged in sedentary
work (i.e. activity level = 1 $met$ , which is about
58 $W / m sup 2$ body surface) while wearing typical winter
indoor clothing (i.e. clothing thermal resistance level = 1 $clo$).

Establish the clothing level which would be required in order

room, where the occupants require the heating to be ON (Tset = 18) from
7 to 9 in the morning, and (with Tset = 21) from 18 to 23 in the evening.
For Saturday and Sunday they also want the heating ON during the
intermediate period from 9 to 18 (with Tset = 19). Mail the energy consumption

Create a simple enclosure.
T}	T{
Before you begin defining an enclosure with
the facilities provided within ESP-r it is a
VERY GOOD IDEA to sketch (by hand on a piece of paper)
the form of the enclosure and
its dimensions.
You have the option to begin with a simple shape
such as a rectangular prism or an extrusion from
a floor plan.  Most room geometries can be evolved
from simple shapes so attempt this first.  If you
have time, try to put in a pyramid shape bypassing
the simple shape option and then entering
the vertices and defining the list of vertices
which make up each surface. Also use the "surface attributes"
facility to give names to each of the surfaces.  West_wall
makes a lot more sense than surf_9 !

for the specifications. Save the resulting zone geometry.

Note that simulations using detailed plant models usually

the small time-constants present in the problem. You should also
