This folder contains models used during comparative testing of the Annex 42 
combustion CHP model. The tests are grouped into 9 series: 

  The 100 series tests exercise the evaluation of fuel compositions,
    and fuel heating value. To pass the 100 series tests, models must
    successfully compute the fuel heating value and molar mass for a
    variety of different fuel compositions.

  The 200 series tests exercise the steady-state performance
    correlations. To pass the 200~series tests, the models must successfully
    calculate the steady-state electrical and thermal efficients, and
    fuel, air and cooling water flow rates.  The models will be exercised
    over a range of boundary conditions and input configurations.

  The 300 series tests exercise the dynamic thermal mass model. To pass
    these tests, the thermal mass model must correctly predict the engine
    control volume temperature, the cooling water control volume
    temperature, and the heat transfer between these control volumes
    in response to varying cooling water temperatures, flow rates and
    operating points.

  The 400 series tests exercise the model's treatment of standby, warm-up
    and cool-down operation. To pass these tests, the model must correctly
    predict the unit's progression through the four operating modes, as well
    as the fuel and energy flows in each mode.

  The 500 series tests exercise the model's treatment of the warm-up
    period fuel flow and power generation correlations, which are specific
    to the Stirling engine configuration. To pass these tests, the model
    must correctly predict the Stirling engine's fuel flow, power and heat
    generation in response to the temperature of the engine control volume.

  The 600 series tests exercise the model's facility for limiting the rate
    of change in the system fuel flow and electric output. To pass these
    tests, the model must correctly predict the rate-limited fuel flow and
    electrical output in response to varying electrical demand.
  
  The 700 series tests exercise the model's low-level controls that protect
    the unit from overheating when the cooling water temperature is to high,
    or the flow of the cooling water is interrupted. To pass these tests,
    the model must correctly predict the unit's response when these
    conditions are encountered.

  The 800 series tests exercise the model's dimensionless control signal
    interface. To pass these tests, the model must correctly determine the
    unit's operating point when regulated by a dimensionless control
    signal varying between zero and one.

  The 900 series tests exercise the model's emissions calculations. To
    pass these tests, the model must correctly predict the carbon dioxide
    emissions produced by the unit in various states of operation.
