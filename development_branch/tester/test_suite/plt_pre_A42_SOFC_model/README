This directory contains test cases for the SOFC cogeneration model
developed on behalf of Fuel Cell Technologies LTD, of Kingston, 
Ontario. This model is being supplanted by the Annex 42 SOFC model 
presently under development.

In this configuration the non-HVAC electrical loads and the control
of the SOFC's electrical output are controlled within the SOFC
plant component coefficient generator.
