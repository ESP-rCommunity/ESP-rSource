Notes on basic 3 zone building with explicit infiltration
and controlled flow:

This set of files is an example of a basic multi-zone
building representation with an air flow network, representing
infiltration and controlled ventilation, superimposed.  Ventilation
is via a controlled door and window.

The problem comprises the following files.

    file                       description
____________________________________________________________
cfg/bld_basic_af2.cfg    problem configuration file defining a basic
                         3 zone model with infiltration and ventilation
                         flow network and control
ctl/bld_basic_af2.ctl    configuration control file defining convective
                         heating and ideal control for zones 1 & 2
                         and dorr & window flow control

                         flow control - the window in the reception
                         is opened if the internal air temperature
                         rises above 20degC.

Hint: During a summer simulation notice how the air flow is
      restricted until the room warms and the window is opened.
      The temperature then drops below 20deg.C and the window
      is closed.  From the results, notice the saw-tooth pattern
      window opens and closes.  The decision to open or close the
      window is taken once per time-step and hence different
      time-steping schemes will give different results.
