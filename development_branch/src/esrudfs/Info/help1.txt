This file contains a description about how to enlarge 
the number of control volumes for the CFD (Computational 
Fluid Dynamics) routine "dfs" over 30x30x30. 

1. In file src/include/cfd.h variables NTCELX, NTCELY 
and NTCELZ should be set to equal the desired number 
of control volumes +2. Variable MCEL1D should be set 
equal to the largest from the above three variables. 

2. Due to interface adapting required, it is wise not to 
exceed the number of 99 control volumes in one direction.
The number of required RAM is linearly growing with the 
number of control volumes (500 000 cv require 64 Mb RAM 
just to run "dfs"). 

3. (Re)Install the following routines: "incl dfs bps prj" 
(command: "./Install incl dfs bps prj" from dir src) 
after giving the command "make clean" in the following 
directories: esrubps, esruprj and esrudfs. 

4. For a large amount of control volumes it is usefull 
to compile the dfs routine with compiler optimisation 
options. This is made by adding the corresponding 
compiler optimisation option (e.g. -O or +O3 - they are 
mashine-and-compiler-dependant !) in file esrudfs/Makefile: 
e.g. f77 $(FFLAGS) -c -O$ < 
or   f77 $(FFLAGS) -c +O3$ .
