_____________________________
 
 Two configuration files has been created: building.cfg_1d and building.cfg_sd.  The former file is for simulating the default esp-r gridding scheme.  The later one is to simulate the structured mesh applied to the surfaces edge_s and edge_w including the edge between them.  

When comparing the results from the default ESP-r gridding with the structured gridding, the stronger dynamic response of the indoor temperature with outside temperature can be seen.
