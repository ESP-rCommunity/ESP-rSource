_____________________________
 
Two configuration files has been created: building.cfg_1d and building.cfg_sd.  

The former file is for simulating the default esp-r gridding scheme. 

The later one is to simulate the structured mesh applied to the 
surfaces edge_s and edge_w including the edge between them.  

When comparing the results from the default ESP-r gridding with the 
structured gridding, the stronger dynamic response of the indoor 
temperature with outside temperature can be seen.

This is an old model. Many of the assumptions associated with the
original project have been lost.
