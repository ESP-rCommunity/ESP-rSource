Notes on house with sun space:

The house is situated on a remote Scottish island in a
high wind location.  The provision of an unheated space
for inclement weather is part of the design brief.  Because
of site constraints, the lounge faces south-west.

The model contains ten thermal zones:
  1) combined kitchen and lounge (kitliv)
  2) hollow south-west wall (west_space)
  3) passage (hall)
  4) bathroom (bath)
  5) bedroom (bed1)
  6) bedroom (bed2)
  7) buffer south-west portion (buf_1)
  8) buffer north-east portion (buf_2)
  9) upper buffer (buf_roof)
 10) roof over occupied space (roof)

The deep window reveals and orientation requires
an explicit treatment of shading and solar distribution.
To this end, obstruction blocks are used to define the
window reveals in the bedrooms and kitchen/lounge.

The model employs seasonally adjusted air flow networks to 
represent air movement.  There are timed extract fans in 
the kitchen and bathroom and control logic to open the 
windows if internal temperatures rise above a specified
level.  

The subdivision of the sun space into 3 thermal 
zones allows the buoyancy force to be represented.
This requires that `fictitious` boundaries be placed
between these zones.

THe south-west wall of the lounge is represented as
a separate thermal zone rather than as a 
multilayer construction because of the large void
(300mm) and the convective/ radiant enchanges
therein.

There are 2 system configuration files in subdirectory cfg, 
for the winter (ss_win.cfg) and summer (ss_sum.cfg) operation
cases respectively.  These reference two separate  air
flow networks flow/ss_win.afn and flow/sssum.afn.
Summer control is based on the opening of windows if
the temperature exceeds the set point.  Winter
air flow is via cracks to the outside, partially open
doors between rooms, and extract fans in the kitchen
and bathroom which operate for several hours each day.

The control files are ctl/ss_win.ctl and ctl/ss_win.ctl
for summer and winter respectively.
