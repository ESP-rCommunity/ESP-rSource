          Notes on Office Model

This model relates to a two floor office block located in
the north-east of Scotland.  The design utilises natural
ventilation to control summer overheating.

The building is represented as 17 zones - 1 for each
lettable space, 1 for toilets, 3 for entry, 2 for
stairs, 3 for ceiling voids and 1 for the roof space.

The model (office_sum.cfg) was established to allow an appraisal of
summer overheating and the ability of natural ventilation
to provide effectvie control. Winter appraisals (with smaller
openings) is contained in a separate model (office_win.cfg).

The zone files are held in directory ../zones, 
while the natural ventilation scheme with window control
(for summer operation) is defined in ../networks/summer.afn (winter air
movement is restricted to crack infiltration as defined in
../networks/winter.afn.  Control is defined in ../ctl/summer.ctl and 
../ctl/winter.ctl for summer and winter operation respectively.

The operation of the windows can be seen if the default
summer simulation is undertaken (early May, 3 or more
timesteps per hour has been defined as a typical assessment)
