Guide to ROOMVENT98 exemplar
============================

This exemplar encompasses both CFD-only and BSim-CFD `conflated'
(type 1 thermal conflation) simulations.  These simulations were
performed as part of an analysis to assess the applicability of
the standard k-epsilon turbulence model for room air-flow
calculations.

This work resulted in a paper for the ROOMVENT '98 conference.
This paper (included here in postscript format) serves as the
main documentation for this exemplar.

Working with exemplar
---------------------
To run the BSim-CFD conflated model, enter the following from ./conflated:
	esp-r -file ROOMVENT.cfg

To run the CFD-only model, enter the following from ./CFDonly:
	dfs -file CFDonly.dfd

To see the CFD gridding, select "Grid visualization" from dfs' main menu.

To perform a CFD simulation, select "Initiate simulation" from dfs' main menu.

To visualize the CFD-predicted flow field, select "Results analysis"
from dfs' main menu.  Then select "Flow visualization".  Note that you must
perform a CFD simulation before visualization results.
