This is a three zone problem where "office" is 
ventilated by displacement.

The "office" is ventilated at a constant flow 
rate of 2 air changes per hour. Cool air is 
supplied to the zone at a slot near the floor.
This exits the zone at a slot near the ceiling
in the opposite wall.

A constant convective heat source of 250W is 
located at the center of the zone (0.697x0294x0.528m3).
The "office" is shown in detail in the image held
in the file" officd.gif.

The temperture of the reception is controlled
during the working hours.
