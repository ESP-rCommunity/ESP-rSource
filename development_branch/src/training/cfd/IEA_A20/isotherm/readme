Working with exemplar
---------------------
To run ESP-r model (non-CFD analysis) of room, enter the following from ./cfg:
	esp-r -file _iso.cfg

To run dfs with the 20x20 mesh, enter the following from ./zone:
	dfs -file case_2_grid_turVZ_KE.dfd

To see the CFD gridding, select "Grid visualization" from dfs' main menu.

To perform a CFD simulation, select "Initiate simulation" from dfs' main menu.

To visualize the CFD-predicted flow field, select "Results analysis"
from dfs' main menu.  Then select "Flow visualization".  Note that you must
perform a CFD simulation before visualization results.
