Starting point: Default testcase ROOM.DFD

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
try-out 1 -  laminar
-------------------

Just to get some idea of the influence of a different grid, I first started
to increase the grid number and its Power law coefficient:
   Y   -20    9.0    2.0
   Z   -15    3.0    1.5
Because of that, also the location of the openings and the walls had to
be repositioned:
   Openings
   Pre  North  1  1  20  20   1   3  0.0  20.0
   Vec  South  1  1   1   1  15  15  9.232E-2  10.0

         Temp              North     1   1  20  20   4  15        20.0
         Temp              Low       1   1   1  20   1   1        20.0

In order to have some reliable results on this first test, the max. source
of residuals was decreased to 0.001.

---> simulation of the case
     500 iterations
     first impression: residuals for Y and Z momentum decrease within 200
     iterations to less then 0.001. De residual of the mass converges, but
     the residual levels at 0.5, which is much to high in order to speak
     of a converged solution.
     Therefore the simulation was continued with a higher under-relaxation
     factor. The value for P was reset to 0.9 and the simulation was 
     continued for another 500 iterations.
     --->
         It seems the under-relaxation factors are much to high. Just after
         the start of the second simulation an increase can be seen for the
         residuals, as well for the mass, as for the momentum components.
         The under-relaxation factors for these momentum components were
         0.5, whereas the starting factor for the pressure was 0.7.
         The temperature and the viscosity under-relaxation factors were
         1.0. However because no buouynacy and no turbulence model was put
         on, these factors did not influence the calculations.

         The simulation is cut off and a new one is started.

It is still tried to calculate a laminar solution, though the problem 
possibly is a turbulent one. If lower under-relaxation factors for the
pressure and velocity-components do not show any progression in getting
to a converged solution, then a turbulent simulation will be performed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2nd try - laminar
-----------------

In the .dfd-file the following changes have been performed:

#   Number of relaxation factors
           3
#   Relaxation factor type       variable       value
           Linear                   P            0.5
           Linear                   V            0.3
           Linear                   W            0.3
#   Initial conditions variable          initial value
               V                              0.5

The simulation with the new relaxation factors and the new intial condition
for the horizontal velocity component shows a much better convergence than
the previous one. Though the residuals for the momentum showed a converged
solution for these equations (<1.0E-3), the continuity equation was not 
totally converged. The residual stabilized at 5.46E-3, which is still a
bit too far above the convergence criterium for this kind of problem.
However the values at the monitoring point do not show any large deviations
since the 100th iteration. For the sake of completeness, the simulation will
be continued for another 500 iterations, without changing any of the 
parameters.

The final results, after 1000 iterations, were:

  res. mass      = 3.56e-3
  res. Y-mom.    = 7.43e-5
  res. Z-mom.    = 3.57e-5

The values calculated for the monitoring values show hardly any change and
therefore this simulation result is accepted as a converged solution,
especially, because the problem is, looking at the velocities at the
inlet a turbulent one.

The results of this case can be found in
  case_2_lam.phi
  case_2_lam.mon
  case_2_lam.tmp


In the next simulation, the turbulence model will be put on.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3rd simulation - turbulent
--------------------------

This simulation starts from the laminar case as described in the second
chapter.

New inputs in the .dfd file were:

#   Variables:
         V   W  T   K  Eps
#   Number of relaxation factors
           5
#   Relaxation factor type       variable       value
           Linear                   K            0.3
           Linear                   E            0.3
#   Time-step interval to print results              result file name
                    1                                      case_2_tur.phi
#   Monitoring position IMON  JMON  KMON           monitoring file name
                          1    3     15                   case_2_tur.mon

After these changes the program was run to see how the calculations behaved.

After reading the case into dfs, the initiation of the simulations resulted
in:

     ' Illegal Instruction (core dumped)', and with it the program stops.


It is not directly clear what caused this message. The input seems fine.

After some joggling with the input I did found some causes for the above
 mentioned Illegal Instruction. But the cause in the one case was totally
the oppposite for an other case, run at an other computer.
Concerning the above mentioned causes; because an isothermal problem is 
under investigation, I put off the energy equation. Some temperatures 
however were (had to be) given in the input file. Simulations for this
input caused Illegal instructions.
When I put the energy equation on again, I got the dfs-simulation running.
The results I got however were completely nonsense. I cannot help but to 
think that I tried this change yesterday also, and then it didn't work 
either.At an other computer, I had almost the same case running, but this
time the simulation was running with the energy equation off, while keeping
the input temperatures the same at all input points.

Yet another explanation could be that the files where the PHI-results
would be written to already existed. However, I have never had any 
problems with that before.

My first guess still is, that the computer capacity sometimes is very low.
At least too low to create the buffer needed for a CFD-calculation.

The reason for the nonsense results are not yet clear at the moment, but
some changes in the input file perhaps will get a better solution.

In order to find out what causes it, I first went back to the laminar case.

[By the way, I changed the grid a little bit, so that the dimensions 
coincided with of the benchmark case {Nielsen-case}. The input for the grid
now is:

#   N. of x-Regions      N. of y-Regions      N. of z-Regions
         0                    1                   3
#   Grid X-direction    N. of cells    Length   Pow. law coefficient
#   Grid Y-direction    N. of cells    Length    Pow. law coefficient
         Y                 -20         9.0            1.8
#   Grid Z-direction    N. of cells    Length    Pow. law coefficient
         Z                  4          0.48           1.0
         Z                 -14         2.352          1.35
         Z                  2          0.168          1.0

]
 
A laminar calculation, only V, W and the continuity equation, showed results
which where, at least qualitatively, and to a certain degree also 
quantitatively OK.
The next will be to include K en Eps in the equations (without T). The
underrelaxation for these variables will be set to 0.3, as was the case 
for V and W, whereas P has a value of 0.5.

The residuals after 200 iterations show no sign of convergence at all. Mean
residual over the variables +/-1.0E+16 (!). Also the monitoring point
shows a nonsense result. For example the horizontal velocity at the
monitoring point was in the laminar case +/- 0.43 m/s, very close to the 
measured one +/-0.38 m/s (turbulent case!). After 200 iterations the result
for the turbulent ESP-r CFD case is -3.389E+4 (!). This also indicates
a qualitative nonsense solution.
The simulation is run another 300 iterations, without changing the relaxation
 factors.

After another 300 iterations, the calculations do not diverge, but 
convergence is very slow, and the figures in the monitoring point don't 
give a confident feeling on the qualitative solution, let alone the
qualitative one. Mean residual over the variables is +/-5.0E+15, Highest
residual is shown by the energy dissipation 1.4E+16.

P.S. al the simulations described so far, are steady simulations, with only
linear underrelaxation used. To see if a false time-step improves the result
the following changes haven been made to the input file.

#   Relaxation factor type       variable       value
           Linear                   P            0.5
           Linear                   V            0.3
           Linear                   W            0.3
           Linear                   K            0.3
           Linear                   E            0.3
           Inertia                  P            10
           Inertia                  V            10
           Inertia                  W            10
           Inertia                  K            10
           Inertia                  E            10

A false time step of 10 seconds is chosen, and again a steady calculation
was started. However this resulted in another Illegal Instruction and a
dumped core.

To overcome this problem, I started the dfd-file without the inertia
terms, but with a maximum number of iterations of 10, so that I could then
introduce the inertia. However, you perhaps guessed it, I was thrown out
again.

------------------------------------
A new start was proposed by Negrao by setting the initial values also for
k en Epsilon, and changing the one for the velocity from 0.25 to 0.0.
The staring points for k and Epsilon were found in previous simulations
(The initial conditions were:
#   Initial conditions variable          initial value
           V                                    0.
           T                                    20.0
           k                                    0.0075
           E                                    0.033
).
Besides that for k and Epsilon inertia values were set (K=0.3 and Eps=1.0), 
instead of linear values. Furtermore, the linear underrelaxation values 
for V en W were lowered till 0.1, whereas on the continuity equation no 
relaxation was considered.

Staring from these moderate relaxation factors, the calculations didn't 
fall down anymore. After some 250 iterations, the relaxation factors were
increased, so the relaxation decreased (V=W=0.3).

Because especially the convergence of V and W was slow (that means they
didn't reach the convergence criteria), it was decided to use inertia for
further and better convergence (V=W=0.1)

The calculation were continued till steady values for the monitoring 
points were reached. For the sake of completeness a number of iteration 
were performed after steady values were reached for the different variables.
(The residuals were:
  res. mass      = 1.056e-5
  res. Y-mom.    = 1.132e-2 (convergence criteria not reached !)
  res. Z-mom.    = 5.915e-3
  res. energy    = 3.844e-5 (convergence criteria also not reached, but 
                             considered less important because of no
                             buoyancy for this case)
  res. T.energy  = 4.508e-6
  res. E.dissip. = 2.125e-6
)

The setup and results for this case can be found in:
   case_2_grid_turPV.dfd
   case_2_grid_turPV.phi
   case_2_grid_turPV.mon
   case_2_grid_turPV.tmp
In this case grid stands for the use of the grid coinciding with the 
Annex 20 dimensions, P stands for a pressure inlet (=outlet) and V for
a fixed massflow inlet.
)

-----------------------------------------------
Use of a Zero gradient outlet was not yet possible, because of the fact
that it was not yet correctly implemented in the dfs. However, it is thought
that the use of a zero gradient outlet is more appropriate in this 
specific case. 

Therefore the code was changed in order to allow a Zero Gradient to be 
selected. This was done through the following changes in bndaryt.F:

C---Zero velocity gradient
C---
C---Only allowed for one outlet, when two or more, use pressure
C
          ARDENT=0.0
          FLWOUT=0.0
          DO 246 I=IOPENi(L,ICFD),IOPENf(L,ICFD)
          DO 246 K=KOPENi(L,ICFD),KOPENf(L,ICFD)
            ARDEN=0.5*(DENf(I,J,K)+DENf(I,J-1,K))*SEW(I)*SHL(K)
            ARDENT=ARDENT+ARDEN
            FLWOUT=FLWOUT-ARDEN*Vf(I,J,K)
 246      CONTINUE
          UINC=(FLWIN+FLWOUT)/ARDENT
          DO 247 I=IOPENi(L,ICFD),IOPENf(L,ICFD)
          DO 247 K=KOPENi(L,ICFD),KOPENf(L,ICFD)
            Vf(I,J+1,K)=Vf(I,J,K)+UINC
 247      CONTINUE

C 245      CONTINUE
C
C---end Marcel---95/06/28

This change was only performed for the North wall. So for the other walls 
the zero velocity gradient will not perform accordingly.

Calculation were performed, starting from 30 iterations with relative high
relaxation factors. After 30 iterations the underrelaxation for V and W
was decreased to 0.5. Results after 1000 iterations show reasonably well
agreement (at least qualitatively) with literature.

During the iteration process the convergence process is not steady, but 
shows a drawback after some 350 iterations. However the process recovers
from it. The velocity components do not show any severe changes causing
the convergence dip, however the pressure shows some change during these
iterations.

after 1000 iterations the residuals had the following values:

The residuals were:
  res. mass      = 2.528e-3 (convergence criteria not totally reached)
  res. Y-mom.    = 7.679e-4
  res. Z-mom.    = 1.079e-3
  res. energy    = 3.693e-5 
  res. T.energy  = 3.423e-5
  res. E.dissip. = 2.969e-5

The setup and results for this case can be found in:
   case_2_grid_turVZ.dfd   
   case_2_grid_turVZ.phi   
   case_2_grid_turVZ.mon
   case_2_grid_turVZ.tmp

--------------------------------------------

From the above result, the only parameters, that didn't yet equal thos of 
the Nielsen case, was the turbulent kinetic energy and eddy dissipation
at the inlet. In order to perform a correct comparison the inlet 
conditions were changed accordingly:

cfcalc.F - subroutine INOUT

again only for the wall under investigation; this time the South wall.

C---Marcel---input different k and Epsilon---as in Nielsen case
          HEIGHT=0.168
          ALENGT=HEIGHT/10
          TEf(I,J-1,K)=1.5*((0.04*Vf(I,J,K))**2)
          EDf(I,J-1,K)=TEf(I,J-1,K)**1.5/ALENGT
C          TEf(I,J-1,K)=TURBIN*Vf(I,J,K)*Vf(I,J,K)
C          EDf(I,J-1,K)=TEf(I,J-1,K)**1.5/ALAMDA/SQRT(AREA)
C---Marcel end


The same solution scheme was used as the one described before. However, now
the calculation was continued untill convergence for every variable was
reached.
This was after 1233 iterations.

The residuals were:
  res. mass      = 4.150E-04
  res. Y-mom.    = 9.975E-04
  res. Z-mom.    = 2.956E-04
  res. energy    = 3.628E-05
  res. T.energy  = 1.357E-05
  res. E.dissip. = 1.283E-05

The setup and results for this case can be found in:
   case_2_grid_turVZ_KE.dfd
   case_2_grid_turVZ_KE.phi
   case_2_grid_turVZ_KE.mon
   case_2_grid_turVZ_KE.tmp

------------------------------------------------------

In order to see how grid refinement influences the results a new case was
proposed originating from case_2_grid_turVZ_KE.dfd.

The new case was changed in order to have calculation grid of 30 * 20 nodes.

#   Grid Y-direction    N. of cells    Length    Pow. law coefficient
         Y                 -30         9.0            1.5

Furthermore the location of the openings and the solid boundaries had to
be redefined

# Opening type   location   Ii  If  Ji  Jf  Ki  Kf   P(Pa) or m(kg/s)   T('C)

      Vel         South      1   1   1   1  19  20        9.082E-2      20.0

----start of simulation

The case was started with the same relaxation factors as given in the
case_2_grid_turVZ_KE.dfd-case. However, after 7 iterations a divergence
occured and at the 10th iteration the programma was internally killed :-(.
So more relaxation was used and finally also transient relaxation factors
were introduced. This resulted in the following starting position:

#   Relaxation factor type       variable       value
           Linear                   P            0.1
           Linear                   V            0.1
           Linear                   W            0.1
           Linear                   T            0.3
           Linear                   K            0.3
           Linear                   E            0.3
           Inertia                  P            0.3
           Inertia                  V            0.3
           Inertia                  W            0.3
           Inertia                  K            0.3
           Inertia                  E            0.3

As one can see a very severe underrelaxation, but with these values, the 
calculation didn't diverge at the 7th iteration step.

The calculation was continued for 500 iterations, the residuals then
were:
  res. mass      = 8.624E-03
  res. Y-mom.    = 1.650E+00
  res. Z-mom.    = 1.174E+00
  res. energy    = 1.002E-05
  res. T.energy  = 3.195E-04
  res. E.dissip. = 2.250E-03


The calculations were continued after the following changes
           Linear                   P            0.3
           Linear                   V            0.3
           Linear                   W            0.3

The calculations were continued up to 1000 iterations, the residuals then
were:
  res. mass      = 8.797E-03
  res. Y-mom.    = 9.278E-01
  res. Z-mom.    = 7.400E-01
  res. energy    = 1.965E-05
  res. T.energy  = 5.991E-04
  res. E.dissip. = 1.606E-03

So the calculations are converging, but slowly because of the still 
reasonably high relaxation. At the monitoring point, the values donot
show clear changes anymore (for 200 iterations already).
In order to speed up convergence a little bit, the false time step is
increased:
           Inertia                  V            0.5
           Inertia                  W            0.5
           Inertia                  K            0.5
           Inertia                  E            0.5
  
After another 500 iterations the residuals were:
  res. mass      = 3.236E-03
  res. Y-mom.    = 2.007E-01
  res. Z-mom.    = 1.144E-01
  res. energy    = 2.872E-05
  res. T.energy  = 2.475E-04
  res. E.dissip. = 4.417E-04
So, the values have decreased more profoundly by increasing the fictious
time step. The residuals are still converging and therefore the 
calculations are sustained for another 1000 iterations.

the linear relaxation is changed:
           Linear                   P            0.5
           Linear                   V            0.4
           Linear                   W            0.4
and so is the fictious time step:
           Inertia                  V            0.75
           Inertia                  W            0.75


The residuals after 2500 iterations are:
  res. mass      = 9.789E-04
  res. Y-mom.    = 3.351E-02
  res. Z-mom.    = 1.097E-02
  res. energy    = 4.384E-05
  res. T.energy  = 1.767E-04
  res. E.dissip. = 3.479E-04
The residuals stabilize, in the last 200 iterations, around the mentioned 
values. Still no convergence was reached, so again more iterations have to
be performed.

Now only the inertia are changed:
           Inertia                  V            2.5
           Inertia                  W            2.5
           Inertia                  K            2.5
           Inertia                  E            2.5

After 3000 iterations the residuals are:
  res. mass      = 1.600E-04
  res. Y-mom.    = 2.463E-03
  res. Z-mom.    = 7.940E-04
  res. energy    = 5.151E-05
  res. T.energy  = 6.986E-06
  res. E.dissip. = 5.005E-05
The calculation is still converging and therefore another 500 iterations
are undertaken. No change in the relaxation was performed.

Convergence was reached after 3082 iterations.
The residuals were:
  res. mass      = 6.624E-05
  res. Y-mom.    = 9.938E-04
  res. Z-mom.    = 3.731E-04
  res. energy    = 5.110E-05
  res. T.energy  = 5.774E-06
  res. E.dissip. = 2.658E-05
