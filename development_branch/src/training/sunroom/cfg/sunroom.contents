Synopsis
 
This is a synopsis of the model room with wall supply and extract, flow also
driven by buoyancy defined in sunroom.cfg generated on Thu Aug 23 18:49:53
2007. Notes associated with the model are in sunroom.notes
 
The model is located at latitude   45.00 with a longitude difference of   0.00
from the local time meridian. The year used in simulations is 1999 and
weekends occur on Saturday and Sunday.
The site exposure is typical city centre and the ground reflectance is 0.20.
 
The climate used is: ESP test climate and is held in:
/usr/esru/esp-r/climate/clm67 and uses hour centred solar data.

The model includes ideal controls as follows:
Control description:
constant heating setpoint, no cooling
 
Zones control includes  1 functions.
20 degC heating with 2.1kW capacity, no cooling
 
 The sensor for function  1 senses the temperature of the current zone.
 The actuator for function  1 is air point of the current zone
 There have been  1 day types defined.
 Day type  1 is valid Fri-01-Jan to Fri-31-Dec, 1999 with  1 periods.
