Parameters of the design of the consevratory as attached to the Linford House


Design 
------

Designed to a) fit on the south facade of the Linford House
            b) create a sense of extension to the living room
            c) be easily accesible from both the outside and the
               inside (through patio doors to the living room)
            d) let the sunrays still penetrate into the living room
            e) inclined roof visually matching the whole house design

Shape and size
--------------

            a) 6.3 x 2.0m rectangular plan (easy to construct, moderate cost)
            b)  
            c) Shape represents the most common conservatory sold in the UK
               (according to Andrewartha of Pilkington Group)
            d) Size considered functionally appropriate for the Linford House
            e) Internal space enough to form an additional living area (when
               temperature inside the conservatory allows)



Connection
----------

            a) Fitted either directly on the existed wall or on a replacement  mass wall 
            b) Use of high solar absorpivity finish to the connection wall and floor
            c) Patio doors between the house and the conservatory can be open in
               cases of strong sunshine to allow warm air enter the house and avoid
               overheating inside the sunspace 


Glazing
-------

            a) Sigle glazing has been used (double glazing to be tested as well - though
               this will increase initial cost)
            b) Double glazed patio doors between living room - conservatory
            c) Framing to total surface area is assumed to be 15% (for most common
               designs it is 10 - 18%)
