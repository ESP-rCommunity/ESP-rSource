The Office_vent folder contains a series of models
of one portion of an office block which explore
natural ventilation issues. The configuration
files are as follows:

office_vent.cfg - base case model with scheduled
infiltration.

office_vent_netinf.cfg - as base case but with 
infiltration represented as cracks in a flow
network and with bi-directional flow openings
between the general office and reception and
the conference room and reception.

office_vent_netvent.cfg - as the network
infiltration model with additional facade
vents added. The facade vents are assumed
to be open at all hours.

office_vent_netvent_ctl.cfg - as the network
infiltration and facade vents model with control
imposed on the facade vents (closed if room
temperatures are below 21C or above 24C).

The images folder includes images of the expected 
performance of the model assuming an Ottawa Canada
climate.
