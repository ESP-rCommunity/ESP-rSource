Notes on pattern files *_kor.opr

These files are based on data from Korean government supported research 
which was entitled 'The Study of the Development of Energy Performance 
Assessment Method and Policy in Buildings', published in Jan. 2007.

In the research, supervising institution was KICT (Korea Institute of 
Construction Technology), and entrusted institution was KIER (Korean 
Institute of Energy Research), and etc. Research code is 2005-E-BD04-P-02

The infiltration data was from minimum ambient air flow which is needed 
from hygienic perspective. (15 m3/(h*m2)). And in order to use ACH unit, 
we assume the height of the room as 2.3 m and that brings 6.5 ACH.

In some of the pattern files casual gains in the operation are the sum 
of casual gain of occupants and that of equipment. That's way ratio of 
convective is 80%. And they were put as casual gain of equipment in 
esp-r since casual gain of occupants uses W unit, not W/m2.
So we divide daily casual gain occurance (Wh/(m2*d)) by running time 
(e.g. 24 hrs a day). 9.7 is correct.
 
Some room types also assume that if there is no occupancy that there is
no required amount of ambient air flow and most of the time there is 
no heat source,  they may set casual gain and infiltration as 0.
