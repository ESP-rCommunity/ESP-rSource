_____________________________
Task: manager_a to have PV modules mounted under the window.

Select BP380 modules. Dimensions 537mm wide and 1209mm high. See data sheet.

1. Create a surface with the correct dimensions. Put in 5 modules in surface "PVmod".

2. Create materials required in materials database:
   OUT: low-iron glass 3mm
      : EVA containing PV cells 3mm (assumed)
   IN : low-iron glass 3mm

3. Make a new construction; assume the PV modules are added to 
   the outside of the existing insul_frame with a 20mm airgap.
   Create new construction "PV_constr".

4. Create a new optical system "PVmod_opt", as the majority of the solar radiation
   is absorbed in the PV/EVA layer and not at the outside surface.
   Assume there is no transmission. Some assumptions needed regarding
   the amount of radiation absorbed and reflected (no data). Note that
   the cells usually have a non-reflective surface to reduce reflections.

5. Now create the PV details associated with this construction.
   - go to "building integrated renewables" and create a new file to hold
     the data (e.g. manager_pv.spm)
   - add a new item
   - enter standard database (/usr/esru/esp-r/databases/mscomp.db1)
   - choose crystalline PV 
   - select the appropriate module
   - edit values if necessary (e.g. number of modules)
   - specify the location of the PV cells - zone, surface and node; 
     we assume that the PV cells are in the middle of the EVA layer,
     i.e. at node 4 (i.e. centre of layer 2)
   - save the special materials file and the model.
   NOTE 1: If the database does not contain the PV module required, the database
   must first be edited. This is done manually at present. Copy the standard
   database to ../dbs, and add a new database item. The format should be obvious.
   In this model, the new module data for BP380 modules has been entered
   in ../dbs/mscomp.db1.
   NOTE 2: The data required, mostly from the manufacturer's data sheets are:
     Voc (open circuit voltage)
     Isc (short circuit current)
     Vmpp (max power point voltage)
     Impp (max power point current)
     Ref conditions: usually 1000W/m2 and 298K
     No of cells in series and parallel
     No of modules
     Empirical constant (for temperature dependence
           - usually 10 for crystalline cells)
     Operating conditions - usually max power point
          (but can be into a fixed resistance)
     Shading - values depend on how shading modules are treated:
       def = default (output proportional to non-shaded area)
       prop = output proportional to non-shaded area
       total = if the module receives any shading it generates no power
       diff = the power output from the PV module is reduced to that which 
              would be produced by diffuse radiation only

6. Run simulation.

7. Results: select "renewables/adv comp" and output "heat/power".
   The column displays the power output from the PV in Watts.
   NOTE: calculation of efficiency needs to be done manually;
   e.g. at 12:30 on 1st simulation day, power O/P is 146.42W
   Incident radiation is 418.3 W/m2 (obtained from the absorbed radiation on the 
   spandrel of 114.65W divided by its absorptivity of 0.72 and its area of 0.381m2)
   The area of the 5 modules is 5 x 1.209 x 0.537 =  3.246m2.
   Therefore the efficiency = 146.42/(3.246 x 418.3) = 0.108 = 10.8%
   Note the efficiency at STP is 12.3% ((cellular_offices_pv.4.55A x 17.6V)/(1000W/m2 x 0.649m2)), 
   - the reduction is due mainly to the temperature effect.

8. The model has a pre-existing electrical network which can be used to gain more information about the 
   behaviour of loads and generation. In project with the cellular offices model loaded manager select 
   "electrical" from the model definition menu. Project manager will read in the electrical file. You
   want to connect the PV array you have just created. Select 'Connect HVAC/PV/Lights/etc.' and click on
   PV_array. Confirm you want to edit the component, and choose to add the PV array. A special material file
   should exist - enter or confirm the name of this file when prompted and an 'Embedded renewables' menu 
   should appear, click on the PV entry, then select "1-phase". From the "Electrical nodes" menu select 
   "PV_node" - this will couple the PV array to the electrical network, with power produced from the PV 
   fed into the network. Finally supply a name for the coupled generation (or accept the current name) and
   accept the current description. Update the network and you are ready to run an integrated thermal/electrical
   simulation. Similarly the "corr_light" node can be connected to the lighting load in the corridor zone to
   supply this load.

9. Re-run the simulation. 

10.The electrical network file you have created handles more detailed electrical 
   calculations - you can examine the detailed results from the electrical network
   by selecting 'Electrical results' from the top level menu. The saved electrical file is 
   results file is 'cellular_offices_pv.libe'. After this has been read in select 'a Graphs'
   to view results. Toggle the 'Focus >> Nodes' to 'Focus >> Whole network' and then select
   'b total generation' and '! Draw graph' - this will show the power output by the pv. To 
   view the total electrical loading select 'a Total loading' and '! Draw graph' - this will 
   show the loading from the lights (note power draw is negative). Finally look at the 
   interaction between the two select / Clear all selections' then 'c Total grid import'; then
   '! Draw graph' this will show the power that needs to be imported from the grid to supply 
   loads after the pv output has been accounted for. To view only the real power flows select
   '# Hide/show output' and switch off all entries with 'VAR' in the resulting list, exit and 
   draw the graph again. Notice that in the evenings real power import is +ve indicating power 
   draw from the grid, however in the middle of the day the value is -ve indivating that there 
   is surplus real power which can be exported.

11.The electrical network gets its boundary data from the building simulation. Look at this interaction
   by changing the lighting load in the corridor zone. During weekdays this is normally 100W during working 
   hours and 50W outside these periods. We will reduce the period the lights are on at maximum power 
   and switch off outside working hours. From the "Zones Definition" menu select 
   "operation>corridor>edit casual gains". Change the Lights data to the following (loads need electrical data): 

   Start| End | Gain spec.| Sensible| Latent| Rad|Conv|Pow fact|Current|Power consump|Voltage|Phase
     0     9     Watts        0         0     0.5  0.5    0.9   Lagging      0          110     1
     9    17     Watts       50         0     0.5  0.5    0.9   Lagging     50          110     1
    17    24     Watts        0         0     0.5  0.5    0.9   Lagging      0          110     1

10. Save the operations file

11. Re-run the simulation and repeat step 10, looking at the difference in the exported power - there 
    should be less power imported into the network.
