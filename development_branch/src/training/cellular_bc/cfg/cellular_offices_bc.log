There are two variants in this folder:

cellular_bc.cfg the basic version of cellular offices from which
most of the other variants have been derived.

The layout of the rooms was taken from CAD data - e.g. the
surfaces are positioned in real-space. There is a ~50mm gap
between the rooms. The partitions are thermally connected
at the same time the geometry is separated.

cellular_measured.cfg demonstrates how one might associated
measured data (e.g. from an experiment) with predictions.

Look in the file notes_measured_data.txt for lots more about
how to do this.
