CFD_room.cfg       basic domain solved without buoyancy
CFD_room1.cfg      with surface conflation
CFD_room4.cfg      with adaptive conflation
CFD_room_afn.cfg   uses a mass flow network with CFD
CFD_room_blk.cfg   uses the conf1.dfd domain file
CFD_room_buoy.cfg   basic domain solved with buoyancy
