*Icons 1.2
# Vector icon database June 2003.
# Patched 12 May by Jon Hand for height of components.
# Patched 23 May by Jon Hand for 5 attribute tags (was 3).
# Patched 17 June by Jon Hand for global attributes.
# Patched 24 June by Jon Hand for external pressure attributes.
#  
# All user defined tags are 12 characters, menu 
# entries are 32 characters. Up to 60 lines of text
# (each line up to 72 characters) can be accommodated.
#
# This type of database can hold icons for several analysis
# domains (bracketed by *Domain and *End_domain).
#
# For each domain there can be several categories of icons.
#  Each category has a tag and a menu entry (bracketed by
#  *Category and *End_category) and contains one or more icons.
# 
# Icons have a tag, menu entry, text, attribute,
#  vertices, edges, circles, arcs, filled polygons and
#  text (bracketed by *Item and *End_item).
# Vertices (*Vertex within range 0.0 to 1.0) are used by:
#  edges (*Edge start vert & end vert & colour name & line style),
#  circles (*Circle centre vert and radius vert),
#  arcs, (*Arc centre vert, start vert & finish vert),
#  filled polygons (*Poly nb of vert & list of vert & colour & fill),
#  dot (*Dot centre vert & colour name & size 0=small 1=4pixel),
#  label (*Label lower left vert).
#  attachment points (*Attach vert and tag).
# Icon attributes (denoted by *Attributes) nb of attributes followed
#  by comma separated text or numbers (must fit on one line).

 the laminar and turbulent flow. Type 20 is more commonly
 encountered in the literature than type 25.

Door allowing two way flow.
Type 130 is an air flow door component which is '
applicable to vertical opening where bi-directional'
flow may exist. Based on an expression by Cockroft.'
Equation: m = rho.f(W,H,dP)
Supplemental data:
 (1) fluid type (air only)
 (2) door width (m)
 (3) door height (m),
 (4) vertical distance (m) between base of door and
     adjacent air nodes (nodes should be at the same
     height). Where this component type is required for
     several locations with different vertical heights
     you should create multiple door components.

Type 310 is a general flow inducer which approximates
a pump or fan by a performance curve (cubic polynomial)
which relates the total pressure rise to the volume
flow rate for a given fan or pump speed and fluid
density.
Equation:
 (dP = SUM (i=0 to 3) ai.(m/ro)^i; which is
       only valid for q,min <= m/ro <= q,max )
Supplemental data:'
 (1) fluid type (1=air, 2=water)
 (2,3) volume flow rate lower and upper limits (m^3/s),

Type 420 is a flow corrector or variable flow resis-
tance such as a valve or damper which is represented
as a polynomial. This approach is as if it were a
conduit with local dynamic losses dependent on the
correctors relative position. For actuation in
this component the configuration control file must be
used together otherwise the valve (or damper) is kept
open during the whole simulation.
Supplemental data:
 (1) fluid type (air|water), , polynomial
 (2) cross-sectional area (m^2)
 (3-6) polynomial coefficients a0 - a3 (-) in:
    C = a0+a1.(H/H100)+a2.(H/H100)^2+a3.(H/H100)^3
 where H/H100 is the relative valve/damper position
 (ie. valve stem displacement of damper blade angle).

Type 40 is a common orifice flow component which is a
basic expression for turbulent flow through relatively
large openings such as a vent in the case of buildings
or a pipe restriction in a hydronic network.
Supplemental data: 
 (1) fluid type (1=air, 2=water), 
 (2) opening area (m^2), 
 (3) discharge factor (-).
The opening area can be modified by the use of a flow
control law.

Door allowing two way flow.
Type 130 is an air flow door component which is '
applicable to vertical opening where bi-directional'
flow may exist. Based on an expression by Cockroft.'
Equation: m = rho.f(W,H,dP)
Supplemental data:
 (1) fluid type (air only)
 (2) door width (m)
 (3) door height (m),
 (4) vertical distance (m) between base of door and
     adjacent air nodes (nodes should be at the same
     height). Where this component type is required for
     several locations with different vertical heights
     you should create multiple door components.
