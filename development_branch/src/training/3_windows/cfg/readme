Model for exploration of the sensitivity of flow to three
different represenatations of single sided ventilation.

Four variants of the model:

a) 3_windows.cfg is three zone model without a flow network
   (so that one can be added during a workshop)
b) 3_windows_legacy.cfg is the model which uses a text-based
   network flow file.
c) 3_windows_do.cfg is the model which uses a text-based network
   file derived fom a graphic network file (equivalent to the
   legacy file)
d) 3_windows_do6.cfg is the model which uses a graphic network
   file.
