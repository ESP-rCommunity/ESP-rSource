Notes: 
This is a variant of cellular_bc.cfg with underfloor
heating via a separate zone and a chilled ceiling via
a separate zone.
_____________________________

ESP-r supports a detailed systems based approach for
representing radiant heating and cooling designs and
it is also possible to create abstract representations
of such designs.  

This model is an example of an abstract approach which
treats structural concrete slabs as THIN zones into
which heat is injected or extracted. If you look at the
details of the composition of the zones labeled floor
and ceiling_slb (in the contents file in this folder)
you will see that the constructions have been created
to represent portions of the slab above and below
the working fluid of the environmental control system.

You will also notice that a heat transfer regime has
been setup in the flor and ceiling_slb zones to ensure
than any flux injected or extracted is transferred
from to the surfaces.

The control of the heating is by time and the temperature
which makes use of a multi-sensor control law which allows
the floor slab working fluid to reach 30C in order to
control the temperature in the room above.
An actual control should sense the room temperature
as well as the slab temperature to limit discomfort.
See the figure about floor heating in the image folder -
because solar gains can cause the room temperature to
vary.  Heating performance can be assessed via the
winter period which has already been setup in the
model simulation parameters.

The control of the cooling is to reduce the ceiling temperature
working fluid to ~16C in order to limit the room temperatures
to approximately 26C.

More notes needed about how to interpret information
within the zone control file.
