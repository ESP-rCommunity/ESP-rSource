Simple ventilation system

This system comprises of six components with duct components
1, 2, 4 and 6 of type 60, a fan component 5 of type
30 and a mixing box component 3 of type 10. In this system,
fresh  outside air is mixed with zone return air which is
assumed to be at a fixed temperature and humidity  ratio  of
25degC and 0.005 respectively. The mixed air is then exhausted
to some other zone in a building. This is a basic arrangement
in that no control, no building and no fluid flows are
included in the simulation.

The simulation for this example was conducted using an
ESP-r test climate file for the period between 9 April and
12 April with a simulation time-step of 15 minutes.

The results from this simulation indicate that the mixing
of outside cold fresh air with the warm return air
results in a substantial increase of outside air
temperature.  A further temperature rise takes place across
the fan due to the internal heat generation in the fan
component.
