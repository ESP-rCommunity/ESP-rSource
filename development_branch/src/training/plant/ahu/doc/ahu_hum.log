 *********** YEAR-ROUND AHU PLANT & CONTROL SYSTEM. *********** 

This directory includes a demonstration on the modelling and simulation
of a combined plant and building system representing a small office
unit (or similarly occupied space) with associated air-conditioning plant.

** Building Model:
The building model is described by three zones, 
each representing a distinct area of the building. 
The three zones being: 1-reception, 2-office, 3-roofspace.
 
** Plant Network:
The plant network augments the building model and consists of 14 
components describing the major items of plant of a typical 
year-round, single zone, air-conditioning system. The components 
required to create the system are:
    * pre-heat and re-heat cooling coils
    * cooling coil
    * supply and return fans
    * air washer
    * mixing box
    * conduit
The system layout is shown in the diagram: ahu_hu.gif

The preheat and re-heat coils are standard flux control heating 
coils taken from the ESP-r plant component database, the maximum 
output of each coil is 3.5kW. The cooling coil is also a standard 
flux control model with a maximum capacity of 1kW. If a greater 
level of granularity is required in the simulation the described 
components can be replaced by the more detailed 3-node models also
available in the plant component database, where a fluid flow rate 
to the heater/chiller unit is controlled as opposed to flux.

The intake and extract in the network provide a constant volume 
flow rate of 0.2m^3/s to and from the conditioned space, this 
corresponds to an air change rate of 5 ACH. The supply air has 
a constant fresh air content of 20%, with the remainder made up from 
re-circulated zone air, both air-streams meet in the mixing box 
component.

** Control System
The reception had control on the air temperature and humidity; the 
other two zones (office and roof) had no control regime imposed, i.e. 
they were allowed to 'free-float'. Four control loops were imposed 
on the plant system:- pre-heating control; re-heating control; 
chiller control; and humidifier control.
Control System Details:

 * PRE-HEAT CONTROL.

Control Law:           proportional.
Proportional Band.     2 deg C.
Output Range:          0.0 -> 3.5 kW.
Control Period:        07.00 -> 18.00

 * HUMIDIFIER CONTROL.
Sensor Location:       humidifier exit.
Sensed Variable:       dry bulb temperature.
Actuator Location:     humidifier.
Actuated Variable:     moisture injection.
Control Law:           proportional.
Proportional Band.     12% RH.
Output Range:          0.001 -> 0.005 kg/kg.da.
Control Period:        07.00 -> 18.00

 * COOLING COIL CONTROL.
Sensor Location:       coiling coil exit.
Sensed Variable:       dry bulb temperature.
Actuator Location:     coiling coil.
Actuated Variable:     flux.
Control Law:           proportional.
Proportional Band.     2 deg C.
Output Range:          0.0 -> 1.0 kW.
Control Period:        07.00 -> 18.00

 * RE-HEAT CONTROL.
Sensor Location:       re-heater exit.
Sensed Variable:       dry bulb temperature.
Actuator Location:     re-heater.
Actuated Variable:     flux.
Control Law:           proportional.
Proportional Band.     2 deg C.
Output Range:          0.0 -> 3.5 kW.
Control Period:        07.00 -> 18.00

Several other control strategies are available for use with the humidity
controller plant network;

Control Strategy               File                            Script
-----------------              ------                          --------
Basic on/off control of      ../ctl/onoff.ctl                  demo1
the re-heat coil.

Basic proportional control
of humidity and temperature. ../ctl/P.ctl                      demo2

Proportional with integral
control of temperature.      ../ctl/PI.ctl                     demo3

When running the simulations without the use of the scripts it is advisable
to keep the time-step small (<3min) to ensure the stability of the solution.
