Notes on simple 1 zone building model with underfloor heating
and ideal control:

This problem description (bld_simple.cfg) relates to an L-shaped
reception with underfloor heating.  The simple representation
contains a single thermal zone and demonstrates the use of an
underfloor heating system.  Specifically, up to 10kW is
supplied to a layer of the floor of the reception based on
an air based sensor. As would be expected in such a system,
the thermal inertia of the floor and the response of the
sensor result in less precise control.

The following files are used in this example problem.
