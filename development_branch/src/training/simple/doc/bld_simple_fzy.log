Notes on simple 1 zone building model with convective heating
and fuzzy control:

This model is rather old and needs to be updated and tested.

This model (bld_simple.cfg) relates to an L-shaped room
with convective heating.  This simple representation
contains a single thermal zone and is used to allow an
exploration of an advanced control regime.

The ideal convective heating control has been replaced by a fuzzy logic
controller which attempts to maintain the room at 21degC. For more
information (for those familiar with control theory) see the notes below.
If you know little about control theory this exemplar is not likely
to be of interest.

The following files are used in this example problem.

Desciption of the fuzzy logic controller.

PID (proportional+integral+derivative) controllers (both traditional and fuzzy 
logic based) are either positional or incremental. The former outputs AN 
ACTUATOR SIGNAL based on the error signal (set point - sensed condition), the 
change of error and the error signal history; the latter outputs a CHANGE IN 
ACTUATOR SIGNAL based on the error and change of error but with no summation 
of the error signal history. 

A modelling facility for all PID controller types is available in ESP-r. 

The results are shown for both conventional and fuzzy logic based 
incremental PI control of a single zone office. In both cases the set point 
for the air point temperature is 21degC.

The number of membership sets are user-specified. Here, five membership 
functions for the error, change of error and output signal are defined:

           NEGATIVE BIG (NB)
           NEGATIVE SMALL (NS)
           ZERO (ZR)
           POSITIVE SMALL (NB)
           POSITIVE BIG (PB)

A look-up rule table onto which the controller inputs (error and change of 
error) are mapped at each simulation time-step, is used as an inference 
mechanism which creates a fuzzy output signal. A given input will normally 
"trigger" a number of rules simultaneously, each triggered rule contributing 
to the overall fuzzy output signal. For example, if the error is considered 
NS and the change of error NB, then the contribution of this fired rule 
to the output will be PB. If, on the other hand, the error is considered 
PS and the change of error PB, then the contribution of this fired 
ruke will be NB.

                       ERROR
                 NB  NS  ZR  PS  PB
                 ------------------
E  C   NB |      PB  PB  PB  PS  ZR             |
R  H   NS |      PB  PS  PS  ZR  NS             |
R  A   ZR |      PB  PS  ZR  NS  NB             | Look-up table.
O  N   PS |      PS  ZR  NS  NS  NB             |
R  G   PB |      ZR  NS  NB  NB  NB             |
   E

The fuzzy output at each simulation time-step is then defuzzified by either 
the centre-of-area or the mean-of-max methods. For the test case considered 
here, the center-of-area method was employed.
