Notes on basic 3 zone building with global control:

This set of files is an example of a basic multi-zone
building representation with global phasing strategy control.  
An energy demand reduction strategy commonly adopted in a BEMS 
involves individual control loop actuators being activated with 
the precondition that nominated control loops have ON status. 
For example, consider the following 3-loop control scheme. 
The user-specified number of scheduled loops is set to `3`, with 
sequence, say: LOOP_3, LOOP_1 and LOOP_2. Thus, LOOP_3 and LOOP_1 
output must both be non-zero for LOOP_2 to be activated else LOOP_2 
will be zeroed at this time-step.

The simulatiom may then be re-run using a different sequence and the 
results compared.

The problem comprises the following files.
