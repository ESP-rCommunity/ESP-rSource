Scripts for NT users/developers:

src2dos takes the whole esp-r source distribution
  and converts it to DOS format and changes include
  statements in the fortran code.

  module and does a DOS conversion and include
  statement changes.
M2dos converts an esp-r model (in standard folders) to
  an NT formatted model (execpt for binary files).
grcomment runs the linux command grep but checks code 
  for continuation lines and associated comments when 
  a match is found.

  by confirming that contents are in alphabetical order 
  and that linked files are removed etc.
