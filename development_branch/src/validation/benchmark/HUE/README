PEG or program for regression equation generation runs thermal
simulations for a large number of models using different climates and
generates regression equations to quantify energy performance as a
function of climatic parameters.

The folder structure and equation generation process is described below:

base_prototype: holds an ESP-r base model from which other models are
generated automatically

climate: holds climate files needed for simulation, more files can be
added as described in the manual

doc: documentation

gen_prototype: holds programs to create the prototypes, simulate these
and to generate results

results: holds final results database (FRDB) of regression coefficients
raw results databases that are made for individual climates are held in
tmp/energy_res. This folder also holds the monthly climate data
summaries to be used with the FRDB

src: source code for some of the programs used

tmp: prototypes once generated are held here alongwith various auxiliary
and support files
