The directory benchmark_model contains:
a) a 3 zone model in various configurations;
b) some scripts to run the models;
c) a set of benchmark results.

The tests cover running the simulator and results recovery:
  with and without airflow
  with and without building control 
  with and without airflow control
  with and without shading
  with different timesteps
  with averaging on and off
  with different save levels. 
In each case, a large range of variables are extracted.

The results obtained by ESRU are stored in the Archive directory.
These results can be used in 2 ways:
a) to check from one version of ESP-r to the next whether there
   have been significant changes;
b) to check the installation on a different platform.

To run the scripts, cd to benchmark_model/cfg and type;
./TEST
in that directory.
