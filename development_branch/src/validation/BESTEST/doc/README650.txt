case 650:

As for case 600 except that control strategy has been changed to
"27,V:
-cooling is on from 07.00h to 18.00h if temp. > 27oC
& cooling is off from 18.00h to 07.00h
-heating is always off
Moreover additional  infiltration rate of 13.14ac/h is included (equivalent to
10.8 ac/h at sea level - see BESTEST manual page 1-11) from 18.00h to 07.00h 
(when the vent fan is on).
