This is one half of bungalo semi (2 BR). Its composition is 
representative of 1970s timber kit public housing 
in the North of Scotland.

Each room is explicitly represented as is the roof space 
and the crawl space. This allows transient occupancy patterns
to be studied as well as the impact on different infiltration
regimes.

2BR_bungalow_tk_p1m_avg.cfg - P1M occupancy with average comfort
2BR_bungalow_tk_p1m_cool.cfg - P1M occupancy with cold comfort
2BR_bungalow_tk_p1m_warm.cfg - P1M occupancy with warm comfort

Note: zone operation files for P2M occupancy are available but
model variants using these have not yet been created.
