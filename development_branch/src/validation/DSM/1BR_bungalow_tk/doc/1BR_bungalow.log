Notes: 

This is a small one BR bungalow. It has an attached entry
and storage area.  Its composition is representative
of timber-kit public housing in the late 1970s in the North 
of Scotland. This is an uninsulated wood structure
with 6" block external veneer with rendering. Inside partitions
are wood.

Each room is explicitly represented as is the roof space 
and the crawl space. This allows transient occupancy patterns
to be studied as well as the impact on different infiltration
regimes.
