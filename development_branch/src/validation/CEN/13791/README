This directory contains the models for the validation proceedures 
described in the draft EC standard: prEN ISO 13791:2005

As the testing proceedures require specific thermal characteristics 
and boundary conditions specific databases have been constructed, these 
are contained in the databases directory.

The directorys contain the following thest (the number refers to the 
section in the standard describing the test):
7.2.2_conduction   This directory contains the ESP-r model 
                   for testing the conduction of heat through 
                   opaque surfaces.

7.2.3_int_lw_rad   This directory contains the ESP-r model 
                   for testing the internal longwave radiation 
                   within enclosures.

7.2.4_shading      This directory contains the ESP-r model 
                   for testing the external shortwave 
                   shading due to obstruction blocks.

7.3_whole_model    This directory contains the ESP-r model 
                   for testing the combined models on an 
                   'ideal' test-cell model. 

As far as possible default ESP-r functionality has been employed in the tests.  
This is not possible in the case of the whole model tests, where source code 
modifications were necessary in respect of surface boundary conditions and 
convective heat transfer coefficients.

Each model has a default set of simulation parameters and a 'pif' file 
containing instrustions for the correct metrics to be extracted from the 
results database for the test.
