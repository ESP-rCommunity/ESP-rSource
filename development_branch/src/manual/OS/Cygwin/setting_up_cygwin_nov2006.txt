                 November 2006 version
 
 1.0 Introduction:
 
 Using ESP-r on a PC requires a compatible operating environment.
 This document discusses how to set the cygwin environment to 
 provide the necessary display, command shell, and low-level 
 library functions and system calls which ESP-r expects to find.
 
 The document also discusses how to install esp-r once Cygwin
 has been setup. There are two options: a) install from a 
 precompiled distribution downloaded from the
 University of Strathclyde ftp server, c) install from
 source. 
 
 Setting up cygwin requires several steps and the use of commands 
 which will be familiar to those who have used Unix/Linux. Please
 read the instructions carefully.
 
 To find out more about cygwin start with their web page
 <http://www.cygwin.com>. This document is based on
 recent Cgywin installers. To save time please review
 the Cgywin site installation documentation in addition to the 
 instructions which follow.
 
 1.1 Before you download and install cygwin:
 
 Prior to downloading and installing cygwin you need to setup
 administrative and normal users on the PC so that your `login`
 to cygwin is similar to that on a Linux or Unix computer. Typically
 this involves an Administrator (who maintains the cygwin and ESP-r
 applications) and a normal user who runs ESP-r (hint user names
 should not have spaces or unprintable characters). If the computer
 is part of a domain then there are additional commands needed
 to create entries in the /etc/passwd file and the /etc/group
 file.
 
 If you are going to take the entire cygwin environment you
 will need somewhat less than 2GB of disk space. If you restrict
 cygwin to packages needed to develop ESP-r then you will need
 somewhat more than 1GB of disk space. If you take a minimum
 cygwin that is sufficient to run ESP-r then you will need
 ~750 MB of free space for cygwin. You will need ~350 MB
 free for ESP-r and Radiance.
 
 If possible, become administrator to do the cygwin install. 
 This makes the whole process easier than if you attempt the 
 install as a normal user.
 
 1.2 Installing cygwin from the web:
 
 Point a web browser at <http://www.cygwin.com> and click on the "install
 cygwin" icon. This will download a small setup.exe application (c:\TEMP
 is a good place to put it) which will be used to download and install
 cygwin components. This same tool can also be used to update cygwin.
 
 Once downloaded run the setup.exe and it will ask the following
 questions:
   a) Where to get cygwin? Choose the option "internet" if this if
      you have a fast connection and will be installing cygwin on
      one machine. Choose the "download" option if you want to install
      cygwin on more than one machine. Choose the "Install from local
      directory" if you have already downloaded a cygwin distribution
      or are doing it from a CD.
 
   b) Where to put it? Take the suggestion c:\cygwin and also
      the default option "all users" and "Unix file type".
      When asked about a "local package directory accept
      "c:\TEMP" if internet or download, or point to a folder
      with previously downloaded files if that is the approach
      you are taking.
  
   c) For an internet or download install you may have to set an
      appropriate proxy (In the University of Strathclyde this is:
      www-cache.strath.ac.uk port 8080)
 
   d) Select a download site. 
 
 Once the ftp site has been reached the next task is to 
 select the packages to install. There are essentially
 three levels depending on how much disk space you want
 to allocate to cygwin and ESP-r. If disk space is not
 a problem follow the instructions in section 1.3a.
 If you want cygwin to support compilation of ESP-r
 the skip section 1.3b. If you just want to run ESP-r 
 skip to the section 1.3c.
 
 1.3a If disk space is not a problem -  
 
 Select all by toggling the "All -> default" to "All -> Install". Note that the
 installer might take a minute to react to this request and it
 can take 30 minutes to download and install with a fast connection.
 
 1.3b Packages for ESP-r development - 
 
 If you want to be selective and only download what is required
 to compile and run ESP-r (and save download time and disk space)
 the following is a useful guide:

  Archive:      tick all
  Base:         tick all
  Database:     optional

                patch, time, units
  Web:          optional (wget is useful)
  X11:          pick at least one window manager (fvfwm is a minimal one) 
                as well as XFree86-lib-compat and everything that starts
                with xorg-xll and then Xaw3D, grace, lesstif, transfig and xfig.
 
 1.3c Packages needed just to run ESP-r:
 
 If you want to be selective and only download what is required
 to RUN ESP-r (and save even more download time and disk space)
 the following is a useful guide:
 
  Admin:        tick all
  Archive:      tick all
  Base:         toggle to default
  Database:     toggle to none
  Devel:        toggle to default
  Doc:          toggle to default and add xpdf
  Editors:      at least nedit, vim & midnight commander
  Games:        optional

  Text:         pick enscript, less, more, textinfo
  Utils:        toggle to default
  Web:          toggle to default plus wget
  X11:          pick at least one window manager (fvfwm is a minimal one) 
                as well as XFree86-lib-compat and everything that starts
                with xorg-xll and then Xaw3D, grace, lesstif, transfig and xfig.
 
 
 1.4 Post-install patches:
                 
 After completing the list the installer will download the various
 packages and put an icon on the desktop.
 
 The cygwin site has a related sites link <http://cygwin.com/links.html>
 with ported software.
 
 Once Cygwin is installed you can move on to the 2nd stage of 
 installing ESP-r and Radiance.
 
 After login into the PC as Administrator (suggested), click on the Cygwin 
 icon on your desktop to start up a cygwin window. This emulates a Linux
 machine within your PC. Use Linux commands to go to
 the /tmp folder or create such a folder if it does not
 exist.
 
 The first time you log in as each user, Cygwin will
 create some `dot` (environment settings) files in your
 home folder. If you log in as Ralph you should be located 
 in /home/Ralph after you log in.
 
 Pick either section 1.5a, 1.5b, 1.5c depending on where you
 got the ESP-r distribution.
 
 1.5 Installing ESP-r by downloading a precompiled version
 
 If downloading from the ftp site <ftp://ftp.strath.ac.uk> as
 user anonymous and with your email address as the password. Go
 to Esru_public and look for the Cygwin folder. Download the
 file ending in .run as well as any readme files to the
 /tmp folder of Cygwin.

 Read the readme file(s) and then (typically as Administrator) 
 run the installer script(the file ends with .run). This will 
 guide you through the rest of the install process.  No compilation 
 is necessary because a complete executable distribution for ESP-r
 and Radiance is included.
 
 When the script is complete, go to section 1.7.
   
 1.6 Compile instructions:
 
 Once Cygwin is installed you need to alter several files so that
 cygwin starts with an appropriate PATH environment variable. This
 process is similar to that for installing from a precompiled version
 but without using the self-extracting installer.
  
 Standard cygwin will install a g77 compiler in /usr/bin/g77
 and there should also be a f77 link. If you issue the command
 which f77 you should get /usr/bin/f77. If you do not, you 
 should create a link to f77 as follows
 
   cd /usr/bin
   ln -s /usr/bin/g77 /usr/bin/f77
 
 Issue the command "logout" or "exit" in the Cygwin command
 window and then click on the cygwin icon on the desktop
 to re-establish the PATH environment variable and get an intial
 cygwin command shell window. 
 
 Create a source folder for the esp-r distribution. A typical
 location would be <home_folder>/src/esp-r ESP-r source code is
 now available via a subversion server (source code control). 

 Instructions for its use can be found on the ESP-r web page
 <http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk>
 Unless you are part of the ESP-r development team you will probably
 want to use the 'export' command rather than 'checkout'.

 Once you have the source code have a look at the Readme file. 
 There is an install script which can be invoked via the command

   ./Install

 and if you want to find out what the install options are

   ./Install -h
 
 
 Install, when run, will have an option for a compile under the
 Cygwin environment. The compile process should proceed much
 as it does under Solaris or Linux or OS X. You will be asked
 if you want to install training files [say yes] and databases
 [say yes].
 
 1.7 After ESP-r install:
 
 Typically users will start up an X display desktop and work within
 that. There are two general types of X display desktop. The first
 approach creates a virtual screen into which ESP-r and its helper 
 applications run. This is usually called a 'rooted' display and it
 requires an .xinitrc in the home folder of each
 user (see below for typical contents of that file)....
 
 exec >$HOME/.x11startlog 2>$HOME/.x11startlog 
 xsetroot -bitmap .esru.x
 xterm -name Console -fn 6x13 -C -g 85X8+0+0 &
 xterm -name Xterm1 -fn 6x13 -g 85X35+0-0 -sb -sl 400 &
 xterm -name Xterm2 -fn 6x13 -g 80X24+350-50 -sb -sl 400 &
 xclock -g 75X75-60+0 &
 xstdcmap -delete all
 exec twm
  
 To invoke a rooted X display desktop 900 pixels wide by 700 pixels 
 tall give the command:
 
   startx -- -screen 0 900 700
 
 The window in command b will be 900 pixels wide by 700 pixels
 high and will have three X terminals running in it along with
 a clock.
 
 The second type of X display starts up a single graphic terminal
 on you monitor and the ESP-r modules can be positioned anywhere
 on the monitor. This is called a rootless display.
 
 Recent vesions of cygwin work with scripts startxwin.bat or 
 startxwin.sh. Either of these scripts can be issued in the
 initial cygwin text command window and they will cause a
 single graphic terminal to start up inside which you can
 invoke graphic applications.
 
 
 1.8 Radiance install:
 
 The precompiled ESP-r distributions include a precompiled
 Radiance version 3.5 as part of the normal install process.
 
 It is also possible to compile Radiance in the cygwin 
 environment. Note that the tiff related modules tend not to 
 compile, but none of these is essential for use with ESP-r. 
 Out-of-the-box (e.g. a fresh download of the standard
 Radiance distribution will mostly likely fail in several 
 places). You will have to manually copy quite a few of the 
 executables and shell scripts to their proper location and
 for this reason we recommend using the precompiled version
 from the ESRU download site.
