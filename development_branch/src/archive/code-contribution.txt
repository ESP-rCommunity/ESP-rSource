Revisions to merge into development_branch:
- r100:103 and r345 of sub-branch Joe_Developer.


Summary of changes:
- If the submitted code bundles together numerous contributions, then
  provide a one or two sentence description of each. Use a separate point
  for each item and clearly indicate whether it provides new functionality
  for the user, repairs a bug, tidies code, or is a work in progress.  Do not
  dwell on the details (these should be contained in the svn log of your
  sub-branch) but rather provide a high-level description that communicates
  the significance of the change to users and other developers.
- If new functionality is provided for the user, then indicate whether this
  affects the Simulator, the Project Manager, the Results Analyzer, etc.
  If this code affects the Project Manager or Results Analyzer, then
  detail this change from the user's perspective.  If a new model has been
  added, then provide a citation to a thesis or a paper that describes its
  theoretical basis.
- If a bug has been repaired, then indicate whether this affects the
  Simulator, the Project Manager, the Results Analyzer, etc.  If it affects
  simulation results, then detail under what circumstances.
- If this change tidies code without providing (at this point in time) new
  functionality or repairing a bug, then clearly indicate this.
- If this contribution is a work in progress that does not provide (at this
  point in time) new functionality or repair a bug, then clearly indicate
  this.
- IMPORTANT: Use proper grammar and spelling!


Testing summary:
- Successfully compiled GTK and X11 versions of ESP-r on Linux
  (GCC 3.4.6).
- Successfully compiled X11 version on Cygwin (GCC 3.4.4).
- Exercised relevant bps and prj menus for both GTK and X11
  versions on Linux. All menus found to work as expected.
- Ran tester.pl over complete test suite comparing Joe_Deverloper@1109 against
  development_branch@1108 using X11 version on Linux.  All test cases passed:
  no differences reported.
