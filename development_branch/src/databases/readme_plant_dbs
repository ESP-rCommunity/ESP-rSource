ESP-r Plant Databases

The ESP-r archive provides four databases for use with plant network
models. Of these, only plantc.db1.a is supported and the other databases
(hvac_bas_plant.dba, plantc.db2.a and plantc.tt.a) are depreciated.
hvac_bas_plant.dba, plantc.db2.a and plantc.tt.a are merely subsets of
plantc.db1.a, and all of the component models contained within these
databases can also be found in plantc.db1.a

The obsolete databases remain in the archive to ensure compatibility with
legacy models, but they are no longer maintained and will one day be
removed. For this reason, users are strongly encouraged to use the
plantc.db1.a database when creating new plant networks. 

Developers adding models to ESP-r are instructed add their plant database
records to the plantc.db1.a file. Revisions inserting new component
models into the hvac_bas_plant.dba, plantc.db2.a, plantc.tt.a or other
plant component database files will not be accepted into the ESP-r
archive.
