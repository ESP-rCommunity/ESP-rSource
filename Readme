3. OBTAINING ESP-r.

ESP-r is distributed via version-controlled source code. The
GPL license encourages you to contribute any changes you made
back into the community.


Version-controlled source code
------------------------------
The ESP-r source code is stored on a publicly-accessible repositories
at <https://github.com/ESP-rCommunity. Although you can compile ESP-r
with only the ESP-rSource.git to get full functionality you have
to checkout all four repositories and create a new folder structure 
to hold the combined distribution. Assuming the folder for downloads is
ESPrgit and the combined distribution will be in ESP-rMaster give
the following commands:

 mkdir ESPrgit
 cd ESPrgit
 git clone --recursive https://github.com/ESP-rCommunity/ESP-rSource.git
 git clone --recursive https://github.com/ESP-rCommunity/ESP-rDatabases.git
 git clone --recursive https://github.com/ESP-rCommunity/ESP-rModels.git
 git clone --recursive https://github.com/ESP-rCommunity/ESP-rDoc.git

Now use a utility called rsync to merge the repositories into ESP-rMaster:

 mkdir ESP-rMaster
 rsync -av ESP-rSource/ ESP-rMaster/
 rsync -av ESP-rDatabases/ ESP-rMaster/data/
 rsync -av ESP-rDoc/ ESP-rMaster/doc/
 rsync -av ESP-rModels/ ESP-rMaster/models/

You can learn more about accessing the ESP-r repository here:

   http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Programs/ESP-r_central.htm

You will also need a folder for the compiled ESP-r. Lets assume 
this is /opt/esru (create it if it does not exist) On Windows
this would be C:/ESRU. 

In the top folder of ESP-rMaster is an Install script. For Linux, OSX and
Cywin a typical set of commands to build ESP-r
is:
 ./Install -d /opt/esru --gcc4 --debug

or for a MSYS2 development environment on Windows:
 ./Install -d C:/ESRU --gcc4 --debug

Answer yes to installing the databases and example models.
more information about setting up computers and development
tool chains are found in the doc/manual/OS folders.


===========================================================
4. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

ESP-r has been installed Linux, Cygwin, MSYS2 and MAC
OS X systems, using a variety of compiler and graphics library
combinations.

While ESP-r has been built on all of the supported platforms and
configurations, it is most routinely used on Linux.  Installation on
common Linux distributions (including Ubuntu, Redhat/Fedora and
Gentoo) using the gcc 4/5/6 (gcc g++ gfortran) series of compiler 
suites has proven robust, and you can use it with confidence on 
these systems.  OSX is similar to Linux in the build process (see
the notes in the doc/manual/OS/Apple folder). ESP-r can also be 
build on Windows via Cygwin or MSYS2 (see the doc/manual/OS/Cygwin
or doc/manual/OS/Native_windows).

Some facilities of ESP-r use the Radiance lighting simulation
suite to carry out tasks. Radiance can be downloaded from
<radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/>. The release of July 2014 4.2
as rad4R2all.tar.gz works with ESP-r.


Architectures
-------------
ESP-r is presently supported on 32 and 64 bit systems.

 -----------------------------------------------------------
                      Linux   Cygwin  MSYS2    OS X
 ...........................................................
 32-bit                  S       S       S       -
 64-bit                  S       S       S       S
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 S = Stable
 X = Not supported
 - = Not applicable

Compilers
---------
Compilation of ESP-r is presently supported with
the following compiler sets:
  - GCC 4.9 - 6.0 (gcc, g++ and gfortran)

Graphics libraries
------------------
Traditionally, ESP-r incorporated an X11-based graphical interface and
could also be built as a text-only shell application. Work is presently
underway to modernize the ESP-r interface using the GTK interface,
and GTK versions of ESP-r can be installed on all platforms provided
the GTK libraries are available.

===========================================================
5. OPTIONAL FEATURES

XML & CSV output
----------------
By default, the ESP-r simulation engine (bps) writes out binary results
libraries that must be post-processed using a separate tool (res). bps
can also optionally export the results directly into ASCII XML and
comma-separated-value formats, provided the GNU libxml2 library is
available on the system.

If the GNU libxslt library is also available, bps can be configured to
translate the XML result file into any user- specified ASCII format.


===========================================================
6. INSTALLATION

Installation of ESP-r is managed through the 'Install'
script, which is located in the top level directory. ESP-r
can be installed into any user-writable directory.

The Install script provides interactive prompts to guide
you through the ESP-r installation, and also understands
a number of command line arguments. For more information,
run:

  $ ./Install --help


Local installations
-------------------

  1. Run the command:

          $ ./Install -d <path/to/esp-r> --gcc4

     Where <path/to/esp-r> describes the desired
     installation directory. For instance,
     './Install -d ~/my_esp-r' will install ESP-r
     in a directory called my_esp-r, in the user's
     home folder.

After installing ESP-r, be sure to update your PATH
environment variable as described below.

===========================================================
7. POST INSTALLATION CONFIGURATION

On most Linux and Cygwin systems, the only post-installation
configuration required is updating the path environment
variable to include the location of ESP-r binaries. 


Updating your PATH
------------------
You'll need to update your PATH environment variable to
include the location of your ESP-r binaries. The steps
required to configure your path depend on the shell in
use on your system. Enter the command:

  $ echo $SHELL

Configuration of the PATH environment variable using the
bash and csh shells are described below. Information on
setting environment variables for other shell types (e.g.,
sh, zsh, ksh) is available on the Internet.

  BASH:

      Append the following line to your .bashrc file in
      your home directory (or in the system's .bashrc file)

      export PATH="<path/to/esp-r>/esp-r/bin/:$PATH"

      (Where <path/to/esp-r> describes the location
      in which you installed ESP-r)

  CSH:

      Append the following line to your .cshrc file in
      your home directory (or in the system's .cshrc file):

      set path = ( <path/to/esp-r>/esp-r/bin/ $path )

      (Where <path/to/esp-r> describes the location
      in which you installed ESP-r)


Setting EFONTS environment variable
-----------------------------------
On most Linux and Cygwin systems, acceptable fonts are
located automatically at runtime. However, if you find
ESP-r crashes after invocation, you may need to set the
EFONTS environment variable. Include the following lines
in your .bashrc /.cshrc file

   setenv EFONT_0 6x12
   setenv EFONT_1 6x13
   setenv EFONT_2 8x13
   setenv EFONT_3 9x15

Default settings
----------------
The file <path/to/esp-r>/esp-r/default defines the default
settings for example problems, climate, control, etc. These
can be changed if the default settings offered in the
standard distribution are not appropriate for your site.


===========================================================
8. DOCUMENTATION

An extensive collection of books, academic theses,
peer-reviewed papers, reports and manuals describing the
theoretical basis and application of ESP-r are available.
A complete list of ESP-r documentation can be found on the
ESRU website:

   http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/publications.htm

Theoretical basis
-----------------
  
  - "Energy Simulation in Building Design" by Joe Clark
    (Butterworth Heinemann 2001) provides a broad
    description of ESP-r methodologies.

Application of ESP-r
--------------------

  - "Strategies for Deploying Virtual Representations of the Built 
    Environment"  describes the application of
    ESP-r in building simulation:
       
       www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Documents/ESP-r_cookbook_june_2015.pdf

  - "Data model summary ESP-r Version 9 Series" describes
    the  format of ESP-r's input files:

       www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Documents/ESP-r_data_doc.pdf

Developing with ESP-r
---------------------

  - "Structure of the ESP-r Source Code Archive"
    outlines the branch structure in use on ESP-r
    central, and procedures for merging code:

       www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Documents/good_practice.pdf

===========================================================
9. VALIDATION

ESP-r has been extensively validated both through comparison
to other simulation programs, and comparison to experimental
data. An overview of ESP-r validation studies is available
at the following URL:

    http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Documents/validation.pdf

In addition, ESP-r includes an option to automatically
perform the IEA BESTEST/ASHRAE 140 and CEN validation tests,
and report these results. You can exercise these tests
by clicking on the 'validation' option in prj.

===========================================================
10. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND RELEASE TESTING

Development of ESP-r continues, and its predictions are
subject to change as new features are added and existing
facilities improved. To guarantee the reliability of ESP-r
results, a quality assurance procedure is performed prior
to each release.
